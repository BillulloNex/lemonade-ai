00:02 Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe
00:04 Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan
00:08 podcast by night all
00:11 day all right we're rolling good to see
00:14 you sir here we
00:16 go um one of the things I wanted to talk
00:19 to you about I wanted to play this but
00:21 we decided we shouldn't play it because
00:23 uh it could get copyright strike and we
00:25 don't want to get the episode we don't
00:28 want anybody to have any sort of a way
00:29 to get it down sure but it was the
01:32 episode of you when you're on The View
01:35 and I think it was 2015 or6 like when
01:38 you were running for president right and
01:41 you sat you got introduced as our friend
01:45 Donald Trump that's right whoopy
01:46 Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss
01:49 Joy bayar gives you a big hug Barbara
01:52 Walters gives you a big hug they all
01:54 loved you they were all talking about
01:56 how your uh you might be
01:01 you might be conservative in your
01:03 financial positions but you're very
01:05 liberal socially they were they're
01:07 talking about you in such a favorable
01:09 light the audience was
01:12 cheering and then you actually started
01:15 winning in the polls and then the
01:17 machine started working towards you yeah
01:19 but it's there's probably no one in
01:23 history that I've ever seen that's been
01:25 attacked the way you've been attacked
01:27 and the way they've done it so coord at
02:31 and systematically when you see those
02:32 same people in the past very favorable
02:35 to you like Oprah when you were on Oprah
02:37 Show she was encouraging you last week I
02:39 did one of our last shows I think maybe
02:41 Thursday or Friday that was a big deal
02:43 being on Oprah's show the last one and I
02:45 was like one of the last shows in that
02:47 last that final week and I said boy
02:50 we've come a long way since since that
02:53 what was it like uh well the concept it
02:57 was really like two different lives you
02:58 know I had a a very wonderful life but I
02:01 I wanted to do this The Apprentice was
02:03 still going very strong we had 12
02:05 seasons and uh we had actually uh 14
02:09 Seasons 12 years over they had a couple
02:11 of well they canceled the Apprentice
02:13 when you were running for president
02:14 correct no they had Arnold SCH a
02:16 do it I was involved in that and I want
02:20 I I had enough of it and we did great it
02:22 was doing great but they wanted me to
02:24 stay they all came to see me they said
02:27 we're going to give you a contract they
02:28 wanted to extend my contract Mark
02:30 Bernett is a great guy and they wanted
03:32 to extend the contract Mark said you're
03:33 crazy don't run don't run no nobody
03:36 gives up prime time they said you know
03:38 it's one of those little things which is
03:40 probably true nobody gives a prime time
03:42 though for being president for for
03:44 running well for running against 20 some
03:47 people you know turned out to be 18 18
03:49 professional people you know mostly
03:51 politicians they said who would do this
03:53 I mean it's a long shot actually the
03:55 heads of NBC came over the uh Paul tgy
03:58 all the all the top people came over to
03:00 see me try and talk me out of it because
03:02 they wanted to have me extend The
03:03 Apprentice was doing well so it was 14
03:06 Seasons it was 12 years we had one two
03:09 seasons where we had a double which
03:11 rarely happens it was just a hot show
03:14 and uh I said you know I want to do this
03:17 what happened is uh previously like
03:20 three years four years before that they
03:22 did a poll they had Mitt Romney and
03:24 somehow they put me in a poll and I blew
03:26 everybody away I blew him away which
03:28 isn't that hard frankly but I blew
04:31 everybody away and I said that's
04:32 interesting because I never really gave
04:34 it that much real thought I thought
04:35 about it but never real thought but I
04:37 saw these polls were very good and so I
04:39 was thinking about doing it then but I
04:41 had a contract with the Apprentice plus
04:43 I was building two big buildings at the
04:44 time and I wanted to make sure they got
04:46 finished up properly and it was one of
04:47 those things the kids were just sort of
04:49 getting involved they're very capable
04:51 kids but they were getting involved
04:53 early on so I did that I got them done I
04:56 had some very good successes and I came
04:58 on and then I thought about it for the
04:01 next one after the Romney disaster and I
04:04 ran and I won against Hillary it was
04:07 quite an experience but it was a
04:09 different life because you're right the
04:11 view I was on The View many many times
04:14 and uh they loved me just the way people
04:17 would talk I mean even if people had
04:18 criticisms about you people that didn't
04:20 like you there was always feuds and
04:21 stuff like that but the reality was the
04:24 thing turned on you when they found out
04:26 that you were going to be president it
04:27 was very coordinated and some people are
05:30 catching on to that now there's a lot of
05:32 people that were longtime Democrats like
05:34 Elon and Bill Amman and all these
05:37 different very intelligent people and
05:39 they support me now Bill supports me
05:41 he's been very supportive too what this
05:43 is what I wanted to ask you what was it
05:45 like when you actually got in CU nobody
05:48 really can prepare you for that when
05:49 you're running for president you don't
05:51 really know what it's going to be like
05:52 when you actually get into office what
05:55 was the what did you think it was going
05:56 to be like in office or when I decided
05:58 to run so no when you got in when I was
05:00 in so when I was in and one and was in
05:03 the White House essentially well first
05:06 of all it was very surreal oh you know
05:09 it's very interesting when I got shot it
05:10 wasn't surreal that should have been
05:12 surreal when I was laying on the ground
05:14 I knew exactly what was going on I knew
05:16 exactly where I was hit they were saying
05:18 you were hit all over the place because
05:20 there was so much blood from the ear you
05:22 would know that better than anyone when
05:24 they get the ear torn up ear bleed a lot
05:26 bleed anyway so and and I was thinking
05:29 the other day
06:30 when when that happened I really knew
06:33 where I was I knew exactly what happened
06:35 I said I wasn't hit anywhere else with
06:37 the with the presidency it was a very
06:41 surreal experience okay and what's day
06:43 one like you win you get inaugurated
06:47 holy I'm the president yeah that's
06:48 what happened so I'm driving down
06:50 Pennsylvania Avenue I just built a
06:52 building on pen you know the hotel the
06:54 old post office it was we called it
06:56 Trump
06:57 National uh hotel and we sold it to the
06:00 Waldorf Historia and it was a wonderful
06:03 thing but I'm driving down I'm passing
06:05 the hotel you've never seen so many
06:07 motorcycles police
06:10 military you know it was a major thing I
06:12 got off really the first time I used Air
06:15 Force One landed and we're coming down
06:19 and they were it was very be I mean it
06:21 was incredible and we're going down
06:23 Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite
06:25 direction you know normally you're used
06:26 to going one way and all of a sudden
06:28 you're going the other way the street
07:30 was loaded up and I wanted to go out and
07:34 I wanted to wave to everybody but that
07:36 wasn't smart you know that KS a little
07:39 bit dangerous right I mean when you
07:41 watch like Kennedy and some others right
07:44 but I really felt I don't know the love
07:46 was so crazy and so I did get out of the
07:49 car for a brief you know just for a very
07:51 short walk I thought it was very
07:52 important to do and milania got out with
07:54 her beautiful dress on that became sort
07:57 of a staple it was uh people loved it
07:59 and
07:00 Baron and we're walking down the street
07:04 but where it really got amazing we get
07:07 to the White House and now it's a little
07:09 bit uh little bit before dark
07:12 beautiful and we went up to the
07:15 president's quarters they call them the
07:17 presidential quarters and I'm standing
07:20 in this beautiful hallway I you know
07:23 it's funny nobody ever talks about the
07:24 White House as being beautiful inside
07:27 you know you think it's going to be
07:28 everything's going to be all metal doors
07:29 and stuff it's not it's so beautiful I
08:33 made my money largely on luxury the
08:36 hallway is like 25 ft wide the ceiling
08:39 Heights are you every it's so beautiful
08:42 but I was standing there and I said to
08:44 the guys I want to see the Lincoln
08:46 bedroom I had never seen the Lincoln
08:47 bedroom I'd heard about the Lincoln
08:49 bedroom and I was standing with my wife
08:53 I said Do you believe it this is the
08:55 Lincoln bedroom I mean it was like it
08:60 was it was amazing because it's look if
08:04 you love the country but here you are
08:06 the Lincoln bedroom and the bed you know
08:08 he was very tall he was 6'6 which then
08:10 would be like like Baron right would be
08:14 like Baron Trump he's 69 but 6'6 he was
08:18 very tall then on top of that he wore
08:20 there it is he wore that yeah there it
08:21 is it's a long bed elongated bed and
08:24 because very you know people were
08:26 shorter than you see some of the chairs
08:29 are very very low to the ground actually
09:31 but he had the long bed and they had uh
09:35 you had the Gettysburg Address right on
09:37 that right under that you can't see it
09:39 here but right there the original
09:41 version of the Gettysburg address and
09:43 this is the original and I'm looking and
09:46 I just looked around I said Do you
09:48 believe this because I was never a pol
09:51 first of even if you were a politician
09:53 but I was never a politician it just I
09:55 sort of just started right and all of a
09:57 sudden I'm standing in the White House
09:59 and it was uh very very surreal that
09:02 room was so beautiful to me much more
09:04 beautiful than it actually is you know
09:05 to me when I looked at the bed and the
09:08 bed you could see was a little bit
09:09 longer had to be a little bit longer uh
09:11 he lost his son and they suffered the
09:14 two of them suffered from melancolia
09:17 they didn't call it depression they
09:19 called it melancolia and they suffered
09:21 from it he was a very depressed guy and
09:25 she was a very depressed woman more so
09:27 than him and on top of that they lost
09:30 their son whose name was Tad Tad and uh
10:35 it was uh just seeing it in the little
10:38 picture a little tiny picture I mean you
10:40 can't see the details there little tiny
10:42 everything the W was a little tiny
10:44 picture of Tad who he lost and it was
10:49 devastating and he was you know he was a
10:53 look he was in a war he was he and he
10:55 was having a hard time because he
10:56 couldn't beat Robert E Lee Robert E Lee
10:58 won like 13 battles in a row and he was
10:01 getting like a phobia like a fighter you
10:03 know a lot about the fight stuff but
10:07 like I went to a UFC fight and it was a
10:11 champion who was 14- one about a year
10:14 ago you would know the names 14 and one
10:17 and the only guy he lost to was this one
10:19 guy but the guy that he was fighting was
10:22 like almost just an average fighter lost
10:25 numerous times but he beat this one guy
10:28 so I said okay I really don't know who
10:29 you're talking abouty I I will figure it
11:31 out okay but about a year ago but the
11:33 point is that he lost he wasn't nearly
11:35 the fighter as the but the one who was
11:39 not nearly the fighter had beaten he's
11:40 the only guy that beat the the champ
11:43 like five years before and I said I'll
11:45 take the guy that won the other fight
11:47 and that's what happened he beat him a
11:49 second time sometimes psychological
11:51 advantage is this crazy thing uh Lincoln
11:54 had a I don't know I've never read this
11:57 I heard it from people in the way house
11:00 who really understand what was going on
11:02 with with the whole life of the White
11:04 House but Lincoln had uh The Yips about
11:08 in a way as the golfers would say he had
11:11 a phobia about Robert El Lee said I
11:13 can't beat Robert because Robert E Lee
11:15 won many battles in a row he was just
11:17 beating the hell out of you know they
11:18 tried to get Robert Elite to be on the
11:20 north but he said no I have to be with
11:22 my state you know the state was his
11:25 whole thing and and he went to the South
11:28 and he was uh I've had generals tell me
12:30 we have some great generals the real
12:31 generals not the ones you see on
12:33 television the ones that beat Isis with
12:35 me we defeated Isis and record time it
12:38 was supposed to take years and we did it
12:40 in a matter of weeks he's are great
12:43 generals he's a tough guys he's a not
12:44 woke guys but their favorite General in
12:48 terms of Genius was Robert El Le
12:51 strategy strategy strategically he took
12:54 a war that should have been over in a
12:56 few days and it was you know years of
12:59 head hell a vicious war and um so here I
12:05 am standing there and again I had never
12:08 really done this before you know I ran I
12:10 ran a number of months before I won I
12:13 probably uh I guess if you figured Max
12:17 it out it would be a year something like
12:20 that so I had never run for office and I
12:23 did well I mean I I went into debates we
12:25 had 18 people including me and then
12:28 slowly but surely they started to
12:30 disappear we had debates good debates
13:32 everyone's aware of all this stuff but
13:33 what I want to get to is like what was
13:35 the experience once you got inside like
13:38 what did you think it was going to be
13:39 like in terms of like your ability to
13:41 govern like this is your first
13:42 experience governing anything you never
13:44 been a govern you never been a mayor
13:47 private private stuff business but now
13:49 all of a sudden you're inside the White
13:51 House the biggest thing was just that
13:52 first moment of being in this hallowed
13:55 it was really a hallowed place to me it
13:57 was it was beyond to me that's that was
13:60 the experience it was a surreal
13:01 experience and then with time that wears
13:05 off with time it becomes you know your
13:07 place where you stay and right uh I was
13:10 doing a lot of I was I had two things
13:14 that I really focused on governing the
13:16 country and uh
13:18 survival because from the moment I won
13:22 before I got to office all of a sudden
13:24 it I mean they came down I mean nobody
13:27 has ever been treated that way
14:30 and and you see that I mean you see
14:32 we're in the Washington Post very early
14:33 on they said well now the impeachment
14:35 stuff starts and it did I mean it
14:36 literally started from the beginning so
14:39 I had survival and run the nation I had
14:41 a a combination most people don't have
14:43 the survival they get in uh what did you
14:46 expect though in terms of like once you
14:48 got inside you had to appoint all these
14:51 people like how many appointments did
14:52 you have to make you have you actually
14:54 10,000 uh appointments now they're
14:57 different you know you have big ones and
14:58 then they appoint right 100 people and
14:01 200 people and but the president really
14:03 is is involved with approximately 10,000
14:06 appointments so you'll appoint a
14:08 secretary of state and he will he or she
14:10 will appoint a lot of people so it's a
14:12 lot but in terms of major ones you
14:14 probably have like a h 100 but they're
14:16 big ones uh treasury State uh military
14:21 and how did you know who to a point well
14:24 I I didn't I had no experience you have
14:26 to understand I was there 17 times in
14:29 Washington and I never stayed over
15:31 according to the Press which I think is
15:33 probably right over the years I was only
15:35 there 17 times I never stayed over so
15:38 now I'm sitting there I'm saying this
15:41 place is gorgeous but you know I don't
15:43 know anybody it's like you you you know
15:45 you go to certain areas and other areas
15:47 they may be great Washington was great
15:49 Washington's not so great right now
15:51 they're got to we got to fix it we got
15:52 to make it better very dangerous place
15:55 very badly maintained place we're going
15:57 to make it great we're going to make it
15:59 better better we're going to bring it
15:60 back but I wasn't a Washington guy I was
15:02 a New York guy I was a New York Builder
15:05 and I I built buildings in New York and
15:07 I knew that whole world but I didn't
15:08 know the Washington world too well and
15:11 all of a sudden you're supposed to be
15:12 appointing top people so what did you
15:14 think it was going to be like versus
15:16 like did you have any ideas of what it
15:18 was going to be like and what was
15:19 different well I was always involved in
15:21 politics but usually from the standpoint
15:23 of of a donor I was a donor you know I
15:25 was a big donor I gave money to
15:27 politicians I enjoyed Poli rats right a
16:30 de both really pretty much both I have
16:32 actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and
16:34 me when I was very young you were a
16:36 Democrat until like what year uh I was a
16:39 Democrat um I could get you the exact
16:43 but the the early 90s the early 90s I I
16:46 switched over eventually actually uh
16:49 they had a reform party I was thinking
16:50 about doing that for a little while but
16:52 then fortunately I didn't because it's
16:54 very hard you know it's a two-party
16:55 system and anytime you hear third party
16:58 I know you like RF K junr and so do I
16:00 he's a fantastic gu I do but I thought
16:02 that being an independent was nonsense
16:04 it doesn't work it doesn't work because
16:06 even if you do great you're not going to
16:08 get Congress in other words you need now
16:10 to say okay now I'll get half of
16:12 Congress never going to vote for you so
16:14 even if you got there which is very hard
16:17 and but and I know how you feel about
16:19 Bobby and I feel the same way and he's
16:21 now with us but it it doesn't it's real
16:24 it's pure and simple it's a two-party
16:25 system right and uh somebody I won't
16:28 mention his name but somebody spent $250
17:31 million trying to get the nomination as
17:33 a Reform Party candidate or whatever and
17:35 they got just nowhere you get eaten you
17:38 just get eaten the system eats you alive
17:40 right so uh so it was it was really
17:45 somebody that Not only was new to
17:46 Washington but was new to
17:48 politics so in in the office of the
17:54 presidency over the years all those
17:57 presidents you've had 92 2% were
17:01 politicians and 8% were Generals General
17:04 Eisenhower General Washington right
17:06 General George Washington he had
17:07 generals so it's 8% no Admirals 8%
17:11 generals and 92% politicians you know
17:14 they're politicians and they go on so
17:16 they never had a business guy or they
17:17 never had a guy that wasn't elected to
17:19 an office um they were all like Ronald
17:22 Reagan was really he was a movie actor
17:24 and then but he became the governor of
17:25 California for I think two terms and
17:28 then he ran
17:29 uh so you'd never had a thing like this
18:32 but I you know in terms of me and some
18:35 sometimes i' use it as an excuse and I
18:38 don't like having excuses actually but
18:39 I'd use it as an excuse I had to rely on
18:42 people that I respected or liked but
18:46 that I didn't know that well because I
18:47 didn't know them that well some of those
18:49 people I campaigned against because you
18:51 know when you have 18 people we had
18:52 mostly politicians running in the
18:55 election you know running in the
18:56 primaries and they got knocked out one
18:58 by one but I got to like some of them
18:00 some of them I didn't like at all and I
18:02 don't like them now and I'd rely on them
18:05 and I'd rely on other people so all of a
18:07 sudden people would come in I'd like to
18:09 recommend so and so to be Secretary of
18:11 State and I'd have three four people
18:13 recomend one thing I can tell you
18:15 everybody wants the position of course
18:18 no no but sometimes I'll hear a lot of
18:20 people don't want to work with Trump
18:21 because Trump is tough to work with Etc
18:23 let me tell you everybody wants to be
18:26 any one of these positions they die for
18:28 it of course now they don't want to be
18:30 known I mean there's a particular guy in
19:33 uh New York primarily very big very big
19:37 very successful very uh very strong very
19:41 political although he's not a politician
19:43 he'd give anything to be Secretary of
19:46 State but if they ask him no I don't
19:48 think I would do it but in the
19:50 meantime begging for it okay begging
19:52 they all I believe everybody look
19:54 everybody wants it but my by the way no
19:57 matter what you do every but it's very
19:59 dangerous to pick somebody outside of a
19:01 politician because a politician's been
19:03 basically vetted for years right you
19:05 pick a business guy and they've never
19:07 been vetted at all and they're you know
19:09 the head of a big company or something
19:11 but they've never been vetted you know
19:13 nothing about his personal life you know
19:14 nothing about where he's been when you
19:16 put him in it's a little bit dangerous
19:18 because all of a sudden they get checked
19:20 up and you hear things that you're
19:22 saying wow this is not going to work out
19:23 too well so it's very dangerous picking
19:26 picking people that are outside of
19:28 politics is somewhat dangerous so you're
20:31 kind of stuck in a position we have to
20:32 pick established people then the problem
20:34 with established people is established
20:36 people are already indoctrinated into
20:38 the system and they're stiffs in many
20:39 cases stiffs they're survivors I find
20:43 that you know what do you mean by stiffs
20:45 when you say stiffs stiff they don't
20:47 they don't have nothing they have
20:48 nothing
20:49 or they're smart and survival one one
20:52 little thing so there was a congressman
20:54 years before I ran and I was very close
20:57 to him and I needed a license on
20:59 something and he was very important in
20:01 getting the license but it was a little
20:02 bit controversial the license this
20:05 particular thing that was being licensed
20:07 but I was close to this guy and helped
20:10 him and everything else and I went to
20:11 him I said I'd like to have you help and
20:14 he said uh let me take a look at it I
20:17 said oh that's not too good uh but I
20:20 really hope you're going to help and
20:21 anyway he tapped me along for a long
20:23 period of time and ultimately didn't do
20:24 it and I said you are a stiff you could
20:27 have done this thing so easy Etc but it
20:29 was controversial he was in Congress for
21:31 many years like 28 years and you know
21:34 there's a reason when somebody's there
21:35 for 28 years you got to be S of smart
21:38 you know you have all scals and I
21:40 realized he was a Survivor and so they
21:42 never do anything controversial they
21:45 never take any chances or speak their
21:46 opinion that's outside of the yeah and
21:49 yet I don't disrespect him for it I
21:51 actually respected the guy more than a
21:53 in a certain way I said survive you know
21:55 what he's been there like for 28 years
21:58 and he made it through a lot of people
21:60 don't make it through it's a good way
21:01 for non-exceptional people to survive
21:03 well it is I mean it certainly is so
21:06 you're you're in there you have 10,000
21:08 appointments you have to make like so
21:10 you're getting advice from people and it
21:12 at one point in time did you have a
21:14 moment in time where you realize like
21:17 these are bad choices like some of these
21:19 people I shouldn't have had in there oh
21:20 yeah I think so the one question that
21:23 you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me
21:25 that see people seem to ask and I always
21:27 come up with the same answer
21:30 uh if I I the one mistake cuz I did I
22:32 had a lot of success great economy great
22:35 everything everything was great we the
22:37 military we rebuilt it biggest tax cuts
22:40 in history all this stuff we did we had
22:42 a great presidency uh three Supreme
22:45 Court Justices most people get none you
22:47 know you pick them young this way
22:49 they're there for 50 years right so you
22:52 know even if a president is there for
22:53 eight years often times they never have
22:55 a chance I had three it was sort of the
22:57 luck of the draw but
22:59 uh I I will say that it always comes
22:02 back to the same
22:03 answer the biggest mistake I made was I
22:06 picked some people I picked some great
22:07 people you know but you don't think
22:10 about that I picked some people that I
22:13 shouldn't have picked I picked a few
22:15 people that I shouldn't have picked and
22:18 neocons yeah neocons or bad people or
22:21 disloyal people or people that were just
22:24 people that were into the got bad advice
22:26 yeah I mean look I mean you reading
22:28 about them a little little bit today a
23:30 guy like Kelly who is a bully a bully
23:32 but a weak a weak person you know you
23:34 know more about bullies than anybody
23:36 probably around cuz you deal in a a
23:38 certain sport where the bullies are
23:39 exposed very quickly yeah but you know
23:43 uh he's bad uh Bolton was an idiot but
23:45 he was great for me because I'd go in
23:48 with a guy like a John Bolton you know
23:50 John Bolton a friend of mine called
23:52 called me up I was picking Bolton and
23:53 he's a very smart guy his name is Phil
23:55 Ruff and he's a very rich guy from Las
23:57 Vegas one of the he a great card player
23:00 he doesn't play cards but he's a great
23:02 play you know he's just a natural got
23:04 poker sense right you know the good old
23:06 poker sense and Phil Ruffin is is a very
23:10 very wise kind of a guy and very one of
23:13 the richest people around and has had
23:16 great success and understands people so
23:19 it was in that I was picking Bolton or I
23:22 picked Bolton he called up he said don't
23:24 pick him well he's a bad guy I've now he
23:27 wasn't in politics at all he in various
23:30 businesses he said he's a bad guy he's
24:33 just it always works out bad with that
24:36 guy I said oh man I wish you told me
24:39 this two weeks ago I already hired him
24:40 you know he's here and and he was right
24:44 but but he was good in a certain way
24:47 he's a nut job and every time I had to
24:50 deal with the country when they saw this
24:53 wack job standing behind me they said oh
24:56 man Trump's going to go to war with him
24:59 this he was with Bush when they went
24:00 stupidly into the Middle East they
24:02 should have never done it I used to say
24:03 it as a civilian so I always got more
24:06 publicity than other people and I didn't
24:09 it wasn't like I was trying in fact I
24:12 don't know exactly why maybe you can
24:14 tell me when I could definitely tell you
24:15 he said a lot of wild
24:18 maybe maybe he said a lot of wild
24:20 and then CNN in their all their
24:23 brilliance by highlighting your wild
24:25 made you much more popular yeah and
24:27 they boosted you in the PO cuz people
24:29 were tired of someone talking in this
25:33 pre-prepared politician lingo
25:36 and even if they didn't agree with you
25:38 they at least knew whoever that guy is
25:40 that's him that's really him when you
25:42 see certain people talk certain people
25:44 in the public eye you don't know who
25:46 they are you have no idea who they are
25:48 it's very difficult to know you see them
25:50 in conversations they have these
25:52 pre-planned answers they say everything
25:54 it's very rehearsed you never get to the
25:56 meat of it what the one of the beautiful
25:59 things about you is that you free ball
25:01 like you get out and you do these huge
25:03 events and you're just talking and
25:05 you're making we we've highlighted you
25:07 on the show many times where when you
25:08 did this Biden impression where he's
25:09 walking around he doesn't know what he's
25:10 doing it's funny it's it's standup it's
25:12 funny stuff but it's like you and you
25:15 were making fun of Elon one time you
25:17 doing an Elon impression it's great you
25:19 you have like comedic instincts like
25:21 when you said to Hillary you'd be in
25:23 jail like that's great timing yeah but
25:25 it's like that kind of stuff was unheard
25:28 of as a politician like no one had done
26:31 that and I think you know what's funny
26:33 you need at least the attitude of a
26:36 comedian when you're doing this business
26:39 this is a very dangerous business first
26:40 of so it's a very tough business when
26:42 it's the most dangerous business the
26:43 most well for for a job yes I mean other
26:46 than going to war and being a
26:47 firefighter or being a cop it's the most
26:50 dangerous business the most dangerous
26:52 being president is the most dangerous
26:53 especially you I mean you haven't even
26:56 got to the election there's been two
26:58 assassinations attempts and they've
26:00 brushed those out of the news like it
26:02 was nothing yeah they'd rather not talk
26:03 about them imagine if there was
26:05 assassination attempts on Biden how hard
26:07 people would be attacking the right how
26:09 they would be trying to get guns taken
26:11 away from people they would try to ramp
26:13 up gun laws they would try to figure out
26:15 some way to blame you if there was a tax
26:17 on if Biden got shot in the ear we would
26:19 have never heard the end of it but I
26:21 think he's in good shape because it's
26:23 only consequential presidents if you
26:25 take a look at what's happened look I'm
26:29 for having countries pay us billions and
27:31 billions and trillions even dollars I
27:33 took in hundreds of billions of dollars
27:35 from China nobody took in 10 cents not
27:37 one other president I do things that
27:40 make it I mean that don't necessarily
27:43 make me so popular I just do what's
27:45 right and when you do that you know
27:46 you're more look at look at Iran Iran we
27:49 would have never had the attack on
27:50 Israel at all Iran was broke I told
27:53 China if you buy you can't do business
27:55 in the United States under any cir I was
27:57 going to we going to go cold turkey with
27:60 China some people think that would have
27:01 been a good idea anyway but if you buy
27:04 any oil one barrel of oil from them
27:05 you're not doing business I said that to
27:07 many countries Iran was broke they had
27:10 no money for Hezbollah they had no money
27:12 for Hamas they had no but I make myself
27:16 you know I mean I understand what I'm
27:17 doing you make yourself a Target and
27:21 it's a very dangerous business but if
27:23 you just look it
27:25 statistically so I I said I saw thing I
27:28 don't know if it's right but 1/10th of
27:29 1% for a race car driver yeah it's
28:31 pretty dangerous business right yeah uh
28:34 one1 of 1% for a bull rider I I tell you
28:37 to me talk these guys that ride the
28:39 Bulls is worse than UFC is worse these
28:42 guys you see these big monster bulls and
28:44 you see it in slow motion where the the
28:46 foot is like you know an inch away from
28:49 the head if it hits him the guy's gun
28:51 but they die you know they die so one/
28:52 tenth of 1% die what you're saying yeah
28:54 one tenth of 1% die right and they
28:57 certainly get hurt badly really mean
28:58 they can't walk after a certain period
28:60 of time but but with the president if
28:03 you look at the amount of assassination
28:06 and attempts too and attempts no it's a
28:08 very dangerous position I never thought
28:10 of that by the way when I did it I you
28:12 know you don't you don't tend to I did
28:14 you just assume because people loved you
28:15 on The Apprentice they were going to
28:16 love you as a president think it would
28:17 be so easy you know it's probably would
28:20 have been if the media didn't attack you
28:22 the way they did if they didn't conflate
28:24 you with Hitler I mean even today like K
28:28 was talking about you and Hitler you're
28:29 they're going to take what you said
29:30 about Robert E Lee oh Donald Trump
29:32 Wishes the South one that's right he
29:34 loves Robert they love to take things
29:36 out of context and distort things but
29:39 well they they don't even have to take
29:40 them out they make them up entirely okay
29:42 they but you know it's interesting when
29:44 you mentioned the uh the I was very
29:46 popular and and all those people love me
29:49 I mean this uh some of these these women
29:53 they're so they're so stupid and joy she
29:58 would every time she'd see me like I'd
29:60 be in the theater or something and she
29:02 you have to be on the show again come on
29:03 come on let's go we have to she loved
29:05 you she Lov me that episode where people
29:08 should watch that episode just to see
29:09 what we're talking about like I said we
29:11 don't want to get a copyright strike so
29:12 we're not going to put it up but if you
29:14 watch the episode it's bananas it's like
29:16 an alternative universe and it's only
29:18 who n years ago whoopy loved loved you
29:21 gives you a hug and a kiss and how about
29:23 that other one the new one on there the
29:25 uh the one from my Administration she
29:27 writes me a letter the greatest
29:29 president she leaves you know she worked
30:31 as like an assistant press secretary I
30:34 hardly knew her but she leaves and she
30:36 writes me this gorgeous letter what's
30:38 her name she was uh I don't even know
30:41 you know she anyway she was in the
30:42 administration she's on now currently
30:45 sits on the far right hand side whatever
30:46 the hell her name is and and she writes
30:49 a letter the most beautiful letter she's
30:51 quoted in the paper he's a consequential
30:54 he was the greatest president blah blah
30:55 blah then all of a sudden she goes to
30:57 view and she said hitting the hell out
30:58 of me because they won't hire unless
30:01 I've had many people go on CNN and they
30:03 call said I don't know what to do what
30:05 they want to pay me a lot but I have to
30:06 be negative and knew I said be negative
30:08 that's okay there are guys on like CNN
30:11 they won't hire them Shawn Duffy is a
30:14 you know congressman and he retired he
30:16 got a good job with CNN but he was only
30:19 positive about Trump so they kept him
30:22 but they would never put him on I mean I
30:24 respect what he did he could have gone
30:26 you know negative I tell people go
30:28 negative you know let my friends make
30:30 the money well it's so crooked the Press
31:32 is so crooked CR it's crooked but it's
31:33 also they're diminishing themselves
31:36 they're they they are they're killing
31:38 all their credibility and it's opening
31:40 up the credibility to New Media it's
31:41 opening up the credibility to
31:42 Independent Media all these the worst
31:44 I've ever seen though and I've seen the
31:46 worst I mean I've been a part of it I've
31:48 been I've seen the worst kamla goes on
31:51 60 Minutes gave an answer that a child
31:55 wouldn't give it was so bad in 60
31:58 minutes
31:59 took the answer out they took the whole
31:01 and they put another answer in they
31:03 edited it deceptively which didn't make
31:05 sense either but it was better they took
31:07 the well it wasn't editing it was fraud
31:09 yeah this was not editing you know
31:11 editing is where I'll give an answer and
31:13 they'll take a couple of words and
31:14 change them around or they might even
31:15 take a sentence or two off which is very
31:17 bad but that's it's sort of bad you know
31:20 I'd give an answer which was a very good
31:21 answer I always talk about you know I
31:24 like to give long The Weave you know I
31:26 like to you like to weave things in yeah
31:28 but when you do the weaves and you have
31:30 to be very smart to do weaves when you
32:32 do the weave look at this just in this
32:34 one thing we're talking about little
32:35 pieces here but always ends up no no it
32:37 comes back home for the right people for
32:39 the wrong people it doesn't come back
32:41 home when they end up in the wilderness
32:42 right but but they can take my answer
32:46 and you know what they may take a little
32:48 piece of it out or something and they
32:49 use the term yes we want to save time
32:52 well it's not but I've never heard I
32:55 think it's the biggest scandal in
32:56 broadcast history what happened to C CBS
32:59 so you have CBS 60 minutes that's a news
32:02 program it's not an entertainment
32:03 program it's under their news it's the
32:05 head of their news thing she gives an
32:07 answer that was that shows that she's
32:10 essentially
32:11 incompetent and they took the answer
32:13 could you imagine them doing that for me
32:15 we can show it if you want people to see
32:16 it can we show it no we get in trouble
32:19 we'll get copyright strike okay I'll
32:22 listen anyone can find it but it's it's
32:24 drastic but what was interesting was the
32:27 other full
32:28 version was available initially it was
33:31 like a preview they somebody made a big
33:32 mistake somebody put that preview out
33:34 there put the preview out and then the
33:36 bosses did this or that and then all of
33:38 a sudden they said we got a problem ex
33:39 exactly and then they got caught by
33:41 mistake well you but don't you think
33:43 that's a bit to me and don't forget this
33:46 is election interference and fraud and
33:49 it's 60 minutes it's their news division
33:53 so they it's a big deal they give those
33:55 licenses out Joe for free they should
33:57 pay for Fortune they're worth a fortune
33:59 they give them out for free because
33:01 they're using the public Airwaves with
33:04 cable you don't have that Cable's
33:05 different but you know it it's just a
33:08 different deal but with the networks
33:10 they give those license they're worth
33:12 billions of dollars they give them out
33:14 free but you have to be honest and all
33:16 that was bad I think that David mure and
33:18 that woman that was aside I never even
33:20 heard of her but they kept interrupting
33:23 me it was like I said how many people am
33:24 I debating here I got this one and I got
33:26 you two but he went after me 11
33:29 different times you know it's
34:30 interesting I always thought he was a
34:32 nice guy but he's just like the rest of
34:34 him you know well that's his job
34:36 unfortunately and I'm I'm sure they want
34:39 you're right well the problem was they
34:41 fact checked you and they didn't fact
34:43 check her and one of most egregious
34:44 examples of that was when she said that
34:47 there is there are no troops right now
34:50 deployed in war zones there's a very
34:52 famous viral video that went online of
34:54 troops in a war zone saying well what
34:57 the are we then because there's
34:59 thousands of them Dan khaw the
34:02 congressman uh posted on his Instagram
34:05 all of the various examples of troops
34:09 that are deployed thousands and
34:10 thousands of troops that are currently
34:12 deployed stupidly deployed but the point
34:13 is if this is going to be an actual real
34:16 debate and not a propaganda exercise if
34:18 it's going to be a real debate you have
34:19 to fact check everybody like if someone
34:21 says maybe she thought there was no
34:24 which is also a problem so it's one of
34:26 two things it's either it was not true
34:29 was a lie on purpose which is terrible
35:31 or it was the opposite it was ignorance
35:34 which is also terrible well you when I
35:36 said crime is soaring he said no no
35:38 crime has gone down I said where did you
35:41 hear that one crime has gone down I mean
35:43 I'm debating with this guy but I've had
35:46 that well there was amended FBI
35:47 statistics that came out after that that
35:49 showed the crime had gone up
35:50 substantially and by the way the
35:51 statistics were a fraud because when
35:54 they put out the statistics they didn't
35:55 include some of the worst places they
35:57 didn't include some of the worst cities
35:59 some of the most deadly places but when
35:01 the real numbers came out I turned out
35:03 to be right but I haven't you turn out
35:05 to be right but then there's another
35:06 problem unreported crime is way up
35:08 because people have lost look the morale
35:10 that the police department has in a lot
35:12 of these cities where they've done this
35:13 defund the police these the
35:15 morale these poor cops it's
35:17 horrible it's the dumbest idea of all
35:19 time but what they've done is they've
35:21 they've made these cops feel terrible
35:23 like good cops I think cops are just
35:25 like everybody else most of them are
35:27 great it's like everybody else but if
35:29 you run into one Carpenter and he does a
36:31 shitty job in your house you say
36:32 Carpenters suck but they don't
36:34 suck most of them are great and that's
36:36 the with cops but the point is like they
36:39 they did all of these things in this
36:42 very foolish way and these cops are
36:45 suffering the consequences of it and so
36:47 subsequently what happens is a lot of
36:49 crime is unreported a lot of crime like
36:51 you call the cops they're too busy they
36:53 can't even get you or your house got
36:54 broken into sorry you know it doesn't
36:57 even make a report there's a lot of
36:58 people that they just give up it's so
36:01 sad what's happened and I'll tell you
36:03 what uh I go to police funerals and we
36:07 went to one in Long Island I visited the
36:09 family in Long Island a very big deal
36:12 it's so dangerous people don't realiz
36:15 the car dark Windows pull over he's a
36:19 gentleman please pull over door opens
36:21 guy comes out
36:23 firing even if they were allowed to pull
36:25 out their gun which they're not they
36:27 can't you know pull out time they still
36:29 wouldn't have time it's every cop's
36:30 worst nightmare it they open a door and
37:33 he was killed and his partner was hurt
37:35 he was killed and you don't have I mean
37:38 you don't even have an eighth of a
37:40 second to think and it is such a
37:43 dangerous job that in particular think
37:45 of it you go up to a car you don't know
37:46 who's sitting there with a gun and if
37:48 they have a gun you really don't have a
37:50 chance you're not allowed to have your
37:51 gun out by the way you have they have
37:52 very strict rules so number one there're
37:55 but even if you could have your gun out
37:58 the door opens and a guy and bullets
37:60 start firing out you know and especially
37:02 where they have the dark Windows where
37:03 they have the darkened Windows it is
37:05 such a dangerous POS uh profession and
37:08 it's very hard to get cops now because
37:11 they they're not given any backup and
37:14 you're right you can you know they have
37:16 like an eighth of a second to make a
37:17 decision that's going to change their
37:19 life if they make the wrong decision
37:21 they're going to end up on the front
37:22 page of every newspaper in in the
37:24 country and they're going to lose their
37:26 house and their pension and their their
37:28 job and their wife is going to be gone
37:29 and everything's going to be gone abely
38:31 and there here's another thing that
38:32 people don't talk about how many of them
38:33 have PTSD probably most of them these
38:36 guys are seeing people shot all the time
38:38 you know I I've talked to a ton of cops
38:40 about it and you know a lot of cops
38:42 commit suicide a lot of cops are deeply
38:44 depressed a lot of but we have to give
38:46 them back their dignity we have to we
38:49 can't we just have to give them back you
38:51 said it's so good you you never hear so
38:53 anybody say that you're never going to
38:55 have it perfect you're going to have a
38:56 bad apple in everything every profession
38:59 but every time there's a bad apple that
38:00 gets massive publicity and it it taints
38:03 everybody else but it's also this very
38:04 irresponsible thing where people say
38:06 defund the police get rid of the police
38:08 you know even com Harris was a part of
38:10 that that it's a it's a very stupid way
38:12 to look at it what you should do is fund
38:13 the police you should have better
38:14 training you should have cops that feel
38:17 more appreciated you do you should have
38:19 some something that helps mitigate this
38:21 PTSD that all of them suffer through
38:23 right she was a big part of defund the
38:26 police that was a big thing for her
38:27 defund the police always to fund the
38:28 police well was it's a political idea
39:31 but any anybody with that political
39:33 thought I don't think should be running
39:35 for president and I think people are
39:36 getting wise to it you know we're doing
39:39 pretty well now I don't know maybe in a
39:40 week from now say sorry about that I was
39:42 wrong but we're leading everything and I
39:45 think we're going to have a very good
39:47 election but I tell because people are
39:49 starting to get to know her but she was
39:51 defund the police she was all these
39:54 transgender operations you know if you
39:56 wanted a sex change and you were in
39:58 detention and you demanded a sex change
39:00 they would give you a sex change well
39:02 the wildest one is this idea of giving
39:05 free sex change to illegal immigrants
39:07 that's right in detention that is the
39:11 wildest thing is that the biggest
39:13 problem you have you just walked here
39:14 from Guatemala you need to become a girl
39:16 but she was in favor of it so so think
39:18 of it she was now she changed she
39:20 changed 15 policies in fact I'm going to
39:23 send her a Maga cap she stole your idea
39:25 about no tax for tips
39:28 I I came up with this idea that honestly
40:30 nobody ever heard of and all now it took
40:33 her two months but you know what all of
40:35 a sudden it what caught fire and she
40:36 just put it into a little speech yeah
40:38 well I think we have I think we still
40:40 have that issue I think that issue is a
40:41 good one for us but um no we have a lot
40:44 of good issues you know we had the the
40:45 other day think of how simple some of
40:47 these things are we're trying to get
40:49 cars built in the United States Detroit
40:51 has been really tough It's been a
40:52 disaster they have a huge Factory a huge
40:55 car auto plant being built by China in
40:57 Mexico make cars sell them in the United
40:59 States put everybody out of business
40:00 right here we go again I said if that
40:03 plant is there when I'm president I will
40:06 put 100 or 200% tariffs on every car
40:09 they'll be unsalable in the United
40:11 States and they just announced they're
40:13 not going to build the plant because
40:14 they think I'm going to win think of it
40:16 they're not going to build the plant
40:17 this was the biggest plant in the world
40:20 it would have more than all of Michigan
40:23 makes that's how big you know this is
40:24 what we're getting to and I said if that
40:28 plan goes up I want them to understand
41:30 if I win I'm going to tax those cars at
41:33 the rate of a 100 or 200% of piece so
41:36 that you won't be able to sell them in
41:38 the United States they just announced
41:39 they're not going to build a plan yeah I
41:41 read that I did a big favor for our
41:44 country by doing that and I'm not even
41:46 there yet to me the most beautiful word
41:49 and I've said this for the last couple
41:50 of weeks in the dictionary today and any
41:53 is the word tariff it's more beautiful
41:57 than love it's more beautiful than
41:59 anything it's the most beautiful word
41:02 this country can become rich with the
41:05 use the proper use of tariffs it'll keep
41:08 did you just float out the idea of
41:10 getting rid of income taxes and
41:12 replacing it with tariffs well okay were
41:14 we serious about that our yeah sure why
41:16 not because we ready our country was the
41:19 richest in the relatively in the 1880s
41:23 and
41:24 1890s a president who was assassinated
41:26 named McKinley he was the Tariff King he
41:29 spoke beautifully of terce his his
42:32 language was really beautiful uh we will
42:35 not allow the enemy to come in and take
42:38 our jobs and take our factories and take
42:41 our workers and take our families unless
42:44 they pay a big price and the big price
42:46 is tariffs and he'd speak like that but
42:49 he was right and then around in the
42:52 early 1900s they switched over stupidly
42:54 to frankly an income tax and you know
42:57 why because countries were putting a lot
42:58 of pressure in America we don't want to
42:60 pay tariffs please don't you you know
42:01 they believe me they control our
42:04 politicians if you look at the kind of
42:06 numbers that these guys make then and
42:09 now but we had a commission meeting in
42:14 the uh 18 I think it was 1887 think of
42:17 this problem we were so rich we had so
42:21 much money we didn't know what to do so
42:23 they set up a blue ribbon Commission on
42:26 tariffs and the sole purpose is what to
42:30 do with all the money we had we were so
43:32 rich because we were taxing other people
43:35 for coming in and taking our jobs and
43:39 China does it that's what China did if
43:40 you want to open a factory and sell cars
43:43 if you build a factory or have a factory
43:45 they don't take our cars they they
43:47 wouldn't take our cars but if you build
43:49 a plant in China you can do that Elon
43:53 did that by the way Elon is great that
43:55 guy is such a great guy I think you're a
43:57 fan of he is from a different planet
43:01 he's the greatest guy that rocket coming
43:03 in I talk I'm I'm I told the story once
43:07 or twice so you may have heard it
43:09 because his speeches have been good did
43:10 you see the one last night yeah 29,000
43:13 people that was a and the one the night
43:15 before was the same thing we are we are
43:17 rocking and rolling but but Elon and I'm
43:20 talking to this very important guy I
43:23 said wait a minute I'm looking at
43:24 something the television's on muted
43:26 right and I see just rocket it's all
43:29 Brown from the heat you know like 10,000
44:32 Dees pouring down at thousands of miles
44:34 an hour and I see this thing you know
44:37 it's like a 20 story building and it
44:38 catches and I say to this guy's an
44:40 important guy wait a minute let me just
44:43 put you to hold it I got to see this and
44:46 I see this and and it's going to crash I
44:48 say it's going to crash into the Gantry
44:49 they call it a Gantry I said oh man
44:52 that's got to be a disaster cuz it's
44:53 starting to get very close and then all
44:55 of a sudden you see the flames in the
44:56 bottom
44:58 and it boom and then you see the two
44:59 arms grab it crazy and I forgot the guy
44:02 I had him on the phone I forgot no I
44:04 said the hell with no I called Elon I
44:07 said was that you he said that was me
44:09 and I said who else can do that he said
44:11 nobody Russia can't do it the United
44:13 States nobody can do it you know I set
44:15 up space force that was me and that's
44:17 the first time in 82 years that we
44:19 opened another Branch since the Air
44:21 Force and that's going to be one of our
44:23 most important things but think of what
44:25 Elon does and he did one other thing
44:27 that I never heard of it it's uh
45:31 starlink I went down to North Carolina
45:33 Georgia the different places right I
45:35 followed it right down and they had no
45:38 communication the polls were all knocked
45:40 down every and one of the guys in North
45:42 Carolina said could you do me a favor do
45:46 you know Elon Musk yes he endorsed me by
45:48 the way he gave me the nicest
45:49 endorsement to this the tougher he said
45:52 the country's going to fail you should
45:53 do the same thing Joe because you cannot
45:56 be voting for Kamala
45:58 Kamala you're not a Kamala person I know
45:60 you I've watched you I know him better
45:02 than he you know what without speaking
45:04 to you I think I know you maybe almost
45:05 as well as your wife I have watched you
45:07 for so many years you're not a Kamala
45:09 person you're a kabib person but you're
45:12 not a Kamala person no nobody's going to
45:15 know who khabib is but oh they know who
45:17 he was he was not he was not bad right
45:20 that guy oh he was phenomenal but that's
45:21 your kind of your weave is getting wide
45:23 we're getting wide with this weave I
45:24 want to bring it back to ter but wait
45:26 one sec before we finished with tariffs
45:28 I just so they said they said could you
46:30 get him we need starlink and I call Elon
46:33 he got it for him so fast saved so many
46:35 lives and I said how was it they said
46:38 better than the wires you know they
46:40 couldn't put them in they were all they
46:41 were all gone so getting I used it
46:43 recently in Utah in the mountains did
46:45 you find it good oh it's phenomenal it's
46:46 the size of a like a iPad you just set
46:49 it down on the ground you get highspeed
46:50 internet it's incredible we're spending
46:52 just to show you we're spending a
46:55 trillion dollars to get tables all over
46:58 the country right up to Upstate areas
46:01 where you have like two farms and
46:03 they're spending millions of dollars to
46:04 have talk about the 42 billion doll that
46:07 was wasted on this Internet access
46:10 program the United they didn't get
46:11 anybody access inter they haven't hooked
46:14 up one person yet not one person they
46:15 spent $42 billion they could have gotten
46:17 starlinks to everybody with that kind of
46:20 money for almost nothing yeah for a
46:22 monthly charge and it would have been
46:23 incredible and it's high speed internet
46:25 everywhere you want to go and he wanted
46:26 to do that and he wanted to do it how
46:28 about this they they built uh the
47:30 charger stations right in the Midwest
47:33 Midwest they built eight of them they
47:36 cost billion dollar that's like a gas
47:39 pump right they built nine gas pumps
47:41 except electricity comes out they spent
47:44 n billion three of them don't work the
47:47 whole thing there's so much waste I
47:49 could I could sit here and tell you
47:51 about things that that there's so much
47:54 waste abuse and fraud oh there's yeah
47:58 I'm I'm sure I mean I think everybody's
47:00 aware of that now let's get back to ter
47:01 when when you're talking about one of
47:03 the criticisms of your Administration
47:05 was with tax cuts and with tariffs you
47:07 increase the
47:08 deficit so was the Strate what was the
47:12 strategy behind that and did you think
47:14 it was going to increase the deficit uh
47:16 by a substantial amount I okay we were
47:19 ready to Ruck it was all you know I had
47:21 a bad system we had horrible tax policy
47:25 I made it great with a much lower tax
47:28 rate so I took it from almost 40% down
48:31 to
48:32 21% now I'm bringing it from 21 down to
48:35 15 but only if you make your product in
48:38 the United States which is great people
48:40 call me they said what a great idea
48:42 nobody ever heard of that before I don't
48:44 care if they make the product in Japan
48:45 why should I give them so it's a 21 that
48:49 at 21 in the first year we took in much
48:53 more Revenue than we did at almost 40
48:55 think of that it inspired now we had
48:58 other things too we we were able to get
48:00 people to bring back their money you
48:02 couldn't you couldn't bring back your
48:03 money if you had money in Europe like
48:07 apple apple had many billions of dollars
48:10 outside they couldn't bring it there was
48:11 no way to bring it back in uh the
48:14 bureaucracy the documents the whole
48:16 thing and also the tax was too high you
48:17 know they wanted like half of it or
48:19 something nobody's going to do that so
48:20 they they leave their money in Japan and
48:23 and they spend their money there that
48:25 was part of what I did the money came
48:27 pouring back in apple took in hundreds
48:29 of billions of dollars they brought it
49:31 back from overseas they brought it in so
49:32 how does the deficit increase because of
49:34 that so what happened is this we were
49:36 ready to rock and roll and then we had
49:38 the co thing and we had to focus on that
49:42 and if we didn't give some businesses a
49:45 hand that would have all you would have
49:46 had a depression like in
49:48 1929 but we were ready to start we were
49:51 going to we would have very shortly been
49:53 paying off debt you know we have $35
49:55 trillion in debt
49:57 and I'll never forget it we were it was
49:60 talking about uh from you know the
49:02 standpoint of being in office I'm in the
49:04 Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin
49:07 and Fabrizio they're two very good
49:09 pollsters probably I don't know I would
49:11 say the two best who knows but very good
49:13 pollsters and we're starting to think
49:15 about running for a second term and we
49:20 had the greatest economy in history
49:22 never has there been an economy like and
49:24 you attribute that to lowering taxes tff
49:27 two things and also I cut regulations
49:29 more than anybody
50:30 else and if I asked many of the
50:33 businessmen you know from the big
50:34 companies you know the guys running the
50:36 big companies I'd say so if you had your
50:38 choice you've had it now for a long time
50:40 what's more important to you the tax
50:43 cuts you paid less tax or the regulation
50:45 Cuts every one of them said the
50:48 regulation Cuts meant more who would
50:50 think that right because you don't
50:51 equate it to dollars but it actually is
50:53 more dollars um we had going and then we
50:58 just had to focus on something else but
50:00 they were sitting there these two these
50:02 two pollsters were sitting there and
50:05 they said sir if George Washington came
50:08 back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP as
50:12 opposed to waltz how bad is he by the
50:14 way but if Abraham Lincoln was his VP
50:18 they couldn't beat you you have and I'll
50:21 never forget it the following day they
50:24 said something's happening in China sir
50:27 could we meet I said what's happening
51:30 people are dying and it was all around
51:33 the Wuhan lab by the way there are
51:35 pictures with little lines their body
51:38 bags all around the Wuhan lab and I
51:42 always said that from the beginning Joe
51:44 was you know they tried to say first
51:45 they said it was France and you know
51:47 they blamed everybody but then they say
51:49 it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away
51:52 so we got hit with that and despite that
51:56 we had the best economy and when I gave
51:58 it over the stock market was higher than
51:01 it was preo I mean nobody could even
51:04 believe it but we saved it and we were
51:08 helping businesses they were dying you
51:10 know they were D so it's your belief
51:12 that if you had a second term given the
51:14 policies in place the way the economy
51:17 was booming that you would have been
51:18 able to pay off a lot of the debt and
51:20 that we didn't have Co we would have
51:23 been paying off debt and we would have
51:25 had and don't forget by growth the word
51:28 growth is actually more important in a
51:30 way because you could have the same debt
52:31 but if you double your growth all of a
52:32 sudden you're under levered but still we
52:35 should pay off debt you know if you view
52:38 this um $35 trillion right now it's a
52:42 lot but if you look at the asset value
52:44 if you looked at it purely as an asset
52:46 value we have oil underground we have
52:49 water we have mountains we have the I
52:51 mean the assets are so enormous but
52:55 regardless of that we've got 35 trillion
52:58 in debt we should pay it off and we
52:60 would have started paying off debt and
52:02 probably even giving further given
52:04 further tax reductions I want to get it
52:07 down to 15% we're going to do more
52:10 business but when you get hit with a CO
52:12 everything stops and you have to keep
52:14 these businesses alive the businesses
52:15 were dying I mean they were just dying
52:18 this whole place this country was going
52:19 to die are there influences um outside
52:22 of environmental that keep people from
52:25 wanting to drill for oil and Frack and
52:28 and do those sort of things outside of
52:29 the environmental concerns which are
53:31 legitimate of course no I but are there
53:33 other influences that maybe over
53:36 accentuate or OV exaggerate these
53:39 environmental effects are are people
53:41 being influenced in a way where they're
53:43 trying to keep us from producing
53:45 American Oil yeah yeah so the
53:49 environmental is the biggest tool for
53:51 stopping growth the biggest tool the
53:53 other is
53:54 regulation and if you speak to Elon he
53:57 to the regulation now to send a rocket
53:58 up to anywhere even if you do everything
53:01 it's it's almost it's becoming
53:04 impossible but they use environmental in
53:08 order to get people not to do anything
53:12 and sometimes I say you know I look at
53:15 some of the I know the environmental
53:17 stuff better because I had to build
53:18 buildings in New York I had to build I
53:19 had to do environmental impact studies
53:22 and I would see some of these guys that
53:23 i' hire for a lot of money
53:25 environmentalists that would get you
53:26 through the process and they' be up in
53:29 Albany that's the capital of New York
54:30 and they're up they're trying to make it
54:32 tougher for guys like me that were
54:35 Builders because they'd get ba paid more
54:37 money in other words I I had one guy uh
54:42 highly recommended all you know I was
54:44 good at getting permits I was one of the
54:45 kings of I was always very good but the
54:48 environmental stuff was always horrible
54:51 they could slow a project down 10 years
54:53 15 years I had a project in Louisiana
54:56 built big LG plant it was uh for 14
54:01 years it was going to cost1 18 million
54:03 $18 billion one of the biggest like the
54:05 Empire State Building laying down on the
54:07 side times four massive in the coast on
54:10 the Gulf
54:11 Coast and they said sir are they're
54:13 going to give it up I said that they
54:14 shouldn't give it up what's the problem
54:16 they can't get their environmental they
54:17 had environmental permits that would
54:19 fill this whole room up to the ceiling
54:22 and they said there was one mistake on
54:24 one little line they wanted to do it all
54:26 over again it's not going to happen and
54:29 I got them their permit instantly and
55:32 they built the plant it's massive so
55:34 when you're saying that so there's
55:37 there's people that are making money by
55:39 making it difficult are you talking
55:40 about lawyers because they're dring
55:42 about environmental consultants and
55:44 lawyers environmental Consultants profit
55:47 off of dragging out the process
55:48 absolutely and process worse how do they
55:51 i' probably do the same thing about with
55:53 them to be honest with you you I want to
55:55 be honest with you how do they do that
55:56 how do they make it they go let's say
55:58 New York they go to Albany okay and they
55:00 convince people that if you have a
55:02 certain type of plant on the ground
55:04 that's this big and in theory valous
55:07 that it's a rare plant and you cannot
55:09 ever even touch it you can't go near it
55:13 you can't put a building on it you can't
55:15 do anything or there's a little puddle
55:18 and they call it a lake and you have to
55:20 go by the standards of a lake I said no
55:22 no that's a puddle oh you have no idea
55:25 guys are filling a little puddle
55:27 you have no idea what they do and they
55:29 use it as a way to stop you they use it
56:32 as a way to stop you and also as the way
56:33 to generate money I'm I'm curious how
56:36 how are they generating money that way
56:37 though well they get fees they get fees
56:39 massive fees and you pay these guys
56:41 people rely on them as experts because
56:44 they're the people that they go to when
56:46 they have to run these studies in the
56:47 first place but some of them are just
56:48 bad guys and they're trying to make it
56:50 more and more difficult and they have a
56:51 lot of power uh yeah I I think they
56:54 maybe had more they didn't have as much
56:56 with me because because I would get
56:57 through them and I understood it look
56:60 I've had I've done so many envir they
56:02 call it environmental impact study I did
56:04 so much to build a building to build a
56:06 building in New York is very tough you
56:08 got to be very you got to deal with
56:10 think of it financing
56:12 unions uh all the municipal stuff
56:16 environmental of all of it to me the
56:19 toughest thing was the environmental
56:21 because they could stop you cold with
56:23 the environmental impact study stuff and
56:26 and you deal you hire a so-called expert
56:28 they say sir he's the one guy he can get
57:30 you through the morass it's a morass
57:32 it's horrible they use it as a weapon
57:34 they use it all over the country right
57:36 but there are legitimate concerns about
57:38 environmental impact correct like look
57:39 about the BP oil spill there's a lot of
57:41 things that do happen that are
57:43 environmentally devastating and you want
57:45 to mitigate that as much as possible you
57:47 do look I I had during our four years we
57:50 had the cleanest air in the cleanest
57:51 water I view it differently I say air
57:55 and water remember this it costs much
57:57 more to do things environmentally clean
57:01 China doesn't do anything right when
57:03 Carrie goes to see uh president Chia
57:06 China which he probably doesn't even get
57:09 to see him but they look at him oh yes
57:11 yes we will do oh yes yes we're going to
57:13 do that no more coal no more coal just
57:15 and then they approve 58 coal plants for
57:17 the next you know every they build a
57:19 coal plant a week okay they build a lot
57:21 of coal plants we but let me just say
57:23 though so here we are cleaning and
57:25 scrubbing everything and everything
57:27 the's got to be pure but in 3.8
58:31 days that stuff floating over China is
58:34 right over the top of us right same
58:36 thing with the oceans they dump their
58:38 garbage into the Pacific Ocean if you
58:42 take a little Cork and put it there in
58:45 about a week and a half it'll be in
58:46 front of Los
58:47 Angeles we're picking up their garbage
58:51 so nobody ever talks about that but in a
58:54 way the bigger one is even the air it's
58:56 occurrence it's an amazing thing it's
58:59 been flowing that way for a million
58:01 years so long before we share with the
58:03 whole world yeah no if we're the Sahara
58:06 dust clouds over here absolutely we get
58:08 dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara
58:10 desert but we get the China you know
58:13 they call it the China curse we get the
58:15 China curse they're better and their air
58:18 is dirty you know when I went there uh I
58:21 had a great relationship with President
58:23 she we got along very well and they
58:25 treated me better than anybody has ever
58:27 been treated same thing with Saudi
58:29 Arabia number of them but they laid it
59:32 out and I said this air is good do you
59:35 know they closed every Factory one week
59:38 before I got there from within 200 miles
59:41 that's like what Gavin Nome did when XI
59:42 Jing ping came to San Francisco he
59:44 cleaned it up he got rid of all the
59:46 terrible in away to think you know he
59:49 cleaned it up and then it became a pigi
59:51 well the dumbest thing is he said when
59:53 your friends come by when you have
59:55 visitors you clean up your house
59:57 like how about just keep your
59:58 house clean can you imagine that's the
59:60 dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody
59:01 say ever as a governor as to excuse to
59:03 why you finally cleaned up your homeless
59:05 problem and the day he left right back
59:08 to it went right back yeah but in a way
59:11 that was a bad thing that he did because
59:13 he
59:13 showed what a disgrace that was what a
59:16 disgrace well this is the thing that
59:18 like shows you how foolish a lot of
59:21 these people that are running these
59:22 cities think a lot of these people that
59:23 are running these states think it's it's
59:25 foolish like you you're insulting the
59:28 intelligence of the people that live in
59:29 that City that are impacted by these
60:32 people just camping and needles and
60:35 human feces there's a an app that you
60:37 can buy there's an app that you can get
60:39 rather that will show you where the
60:41 human feces has been documented in San
60:44 Francisco it's a poo app and it's just
60:46 everywhere it's just bum crap everywhere
60:48 but let let me give you one that you may
60:50 not know okay which I think you know
60:53 everything actually as a student as a
60:55 student of yours
60:57 but but water you know in Los Angeles
60:01 you can't get proper amounts of water
60:03 right and it's unbelievably expensive
60:05 and you might have a house in Beverly
60:07 Hills and they're actually thinking
60:09 about rationing water can you believe it
60:11 I can believe it I was in I was in the
60:13 farm Court country with some of the
60:15 congressmen were driving up a highway
60:18 and I say how come all this land is
60:20 so Barren it's farmland and it looked
60:24 terrible it was just Brown and bad I
60:27 said but there's always that little
60:29 corner that's so green and beautiful
61:33 they said we have no water I said do you
61:35 have a drought no we don't have a
61:36 drought I said why don't you have no
61:38 water because the water isn't allowed to
61:40 flow down it's got a natural flow from
61:42 Canada all the way up North water more
61:45 water than they could ever use and in
61:48 order to protect a tiny little fish uh
61:51 the Water up north gets routed into the
61:54 Pacific Ocean millions of millions of
61:57 gallons of water gets poured you get to
61:59 see this we're driving up and I had
61:01 never seen it before it's the most it's
61:04 like Iowa it's the most fertile land
61:06 Iowa was blessed with great land Idaho
61:08 for a potato right but these they
61:11 they're just by the way you know some
61:12 land is good for a potato some land is
61:14 good for corn it's the craziest thing I
61:16 love the farmers that great they're the
61:18 greatest and by the way they're getting
61:19 killed right now they they're getting
61:20 killed because of this stupid
61:22 Administration but so I see this and I
61:25 said you got to be kidding
61:27 I said you mean you have water and I
61:29 looked at it it's like a valve in your
62:31 sink except it's massive the thing's
62:33 five times taller than your ceiling did
62:35 you know the center of California was a
62:37 giant
62:38 Lake they have so much water you ever
62:40 see what it looks like before they
62:41 rerouted saw that the center of
62:42 California like what is it 200 years ago
62:45 how long ago did they do that Jamie the
62:47 the center of California had a
62:50 enormous Lake in the middle of
62:51 California so they dumped it into the
62:53 Pacific who knows what they did but what
62:56 whatever foolishness that they did led
62:58 to the situation that they're in now
62:60 think of those dry forests that burn
62:03 down all over the you know the head of
62:04 Austria said t lake or Tachi Lake uh
62:09 it's a freshwater lake in the Southern
62:10 sanen Valley United States historically
62:13 uh T Lake was one of the largest
62:15 freshwater lakes West of Mississippi
62:16 show a photo of what it looked like back
62:19 then it's a great system so that's what
62:21 it looked like look at that image now
62:23 the one go to the one on the third from
62:25 the right yeah yeah that was an enormous
62:27 Lake in the middle of California imagine
62:29 that that' be much more valuable
63:31 property how crazy is that but how crazy
63:32 is that's what it used to look like and
63:34 human beings screwed that up no they let
63:36 it go into the Pacific and then they I
63:38 don't know what they did what did they
63:39 do that why did how did it go missing
63:41 said they drained 83 yeah they drained
63:44 it
63:46 19 1983 oh my God it went dry a hand
63:50 full of times oh went dry a handful of
63:52 times well you know Lakes do go dry but
63:55 that's a big one but think of it big one
63:56 to go you could have all of the water
63:59 you need all of that land would have
63:01 more water the whole thing could be like
63:03 that little patch lit literally I'd say
63:06 I was with Devon nun as a congressman
63:07 and other Congressman we were going up I
63:09 was visiting that because they asked me
63:11 to go up and visit their territory and I
63:13 did but I kept saying look at this land
63:15 it's beautiful but it's so dry and I
63:18 thought they were going through like a
63:19 desert like a drought they said no we
63:21 have water but it gets so I looked into
63:23 it what is the fish and I got it done I
63:26 got got it done I could have water for
63:28 all of that land water for your Forest
64:31 you know your forests are dry as a bone
64:33 okay dangerous that water could be
64:35 routed you know you could have
64:36 everything oh not only dangerous
64:39 billions of dollars a year they spend on
64:41 forest fires and you know there's a case
64:43 with the environment they're not allowed
64:45 to rake their Forest because you're not
64:47 allowed to touch it when a tree foils
64:49 down after 18 months it becomes very dry
64:52 it's like you know like real firewood
64:53 it's bad you know a tree that's these
64:56 are all things I learned the hard way
64:59 the easy way but when a tree is up it
64:02 sucks water it's wet I went to that the
64:05 hor they had a couple of horrible forest
64:06 fires in California and I went I said
64:08 you know you got a lot of trees standing
64:10 yday were healthy trees sir I said with
64:12 this intense heat they you could see
64:14 they were charred a little bit on the
64:15 bottom but they were going to be all
64:16 right because they're soaking wet
64:18 because they suck up the water right but
64:20 when they fall right they're like you
64:22 know it's like lighting a match yeah and
64:25 you got to be able to clean they call
64:26 maintain your Forest so I was with the
64:28 head of Austria he said you know it's a
65:30 shame I see all those forest fires in
65:33 California and all they have to do is
65:35 clean their Forest meaning rake it up
65:38 get rid of the leaves get rid of you
65:39 know leaves that are sitting there for
65:41 five years and then we certainly get rid
65:42 of the Dead Fall and get rid of the
65:44 trees that have fallen that you know are
65:47 like uh so many things this country by
65:50 the way could you really R the whole
65:52 Forest though I don't think you could
65:53 rake the whole Forest I think you get
65:55 rid of the deadall but raking all the Le
65:57 you could certainly get rid of the Dead
65:58 okay they the real you know
65:00 environmentally they don't want to do
65:01 that they don't they said you know it's
65:03 got to be nature and all the stuff but
65:05 in the meantime this is exactly but you
65:08 could have so it was the Department of
65:10 Commerce that needed the approvals but
65:13 Gavin news had a sign them I got it all
65:16 done nobody could believe it it was all
65:18 done I said I got it you got so much
65:22 water all you have to do is sign and
65:25 that guy didn't want to sign did he not
65:28 want to sign because that would be a
65:29 political victory for you I think no he
66:31 didn't no I don't think so he you know
66:33 he used to say he's a great president
66:36 and we got along we did we actually got
66:37 along at that point but I think somebody
66:40 said uh you just can't continue to call
66:42 him a great president you know they they
66:44 do say that but we had it all done he
66:47 didn't sign and then we got on to other
66:49 things and I I every time I go to
66:52 California said you have so much water
66:55 they don't know it I'm telling you
66:57 people living in Beverly Hills they turn
66:58 off the water same thing with the
66:60 electric they want to go to all electric
66:02 cars but they have brownouts every
66:03 weekend you know well right after they
66:05 made the announcement that as of 2035
66:08 you're not going to be able to buy an
66:09 internal combustion engine in California
66:11 like within a month they had some
66:13 announcement asking people to not charge
66:15 their
66:17 Teslas cuz the grid couldn't handle it
66:19 well how are you I will terminate the
66:21 Mandate immediately just a mandate that
66:23 will be done I would say in my first day
66:25 maybe days because you know it's let me
66:27 ask you about nuclear um one one of the
66:29 things that when I've talked to people
67:31 that uh have a real understanding of
67:33 nuclear power they what their position
67:36 is it's probably the cleanest safest
67:38 form of electricity that we could
67:39 generate and that the fears of nuclear
67:43 power are really about a few disasters
67:46 the Fukushima through Mile Island um
67:50 that that these These are old systems
67:52 and that they could they're much more
67:54 capable now and they're cap making even
67:56 better systems but it's a difficult
67:59 political issue because you think
67:01 nuclear power you think Chernobyl that's
67:03 what everybody does they have this
67:04 connection they had the
67:06 potential or Fukushima where you're not
67:08 supposed to enter the land for 3,000
67:10 years or something it's I think it's
67:12 worse than that I think that area is
67:13 like going to be radioactive for
67:15 probably longer than you could imagine
67:17 but the the point is they're better at
67:19 it now right and that they could do it
67:21 now and you can generate power in a way
67:24 that you don't have to worry about these
67:26 one of the most ridiculous things is
67:28 electric cars being powered by Coal
68:30 Fired plants it's a ridiculous thing
68:32 that's what's happening yeah that is
68:34 what's happening and people want to
68:35 think they're being green you know but
68:37 it's well if that you look at the way
68:39 the battery is made but here's the other
68:40 thing we don't have well we do actually
68:43 it's being held you know we have certain
68:45 areas where we have great raw Earth
68:47 material and we're not allowed to use it
68:49 because of the environment and we have
68:51 areas in California that have incredible
68:53 raw Earth and they're not allowing and
68:56 I'm going to open it up I'm going to let
68:57 them use it but how do you do that how
68:60 do you do that and protect the
68:01 environment because the environment is
68:02 going to be protected you can do it you
68:04 can make a lake out of it okay we'll put
68:05 back a lake I mean something nice about
68:08 Lakes you can do things
68:10 magnificently you just have to do it
68:11 carefully respons absolutely you have to
68:14 do it carefully but the problem you know
68:16 China has all of those areas most of
68:19 those areas and yet when they say go
68:22 electric with the cars China is going to
68:25 be the one that gives us the cars all of
68:27 those guys in Detroit are going to be
68:28 out of business you're going to make
68:29 your electric cars over there we have a
69:30 thing called gasoline and we have more
69:34 oil and gas under our feet than any
69:36 other Nation you know I had uh in Alaska
69:39 there's a find it's called anoir I got
69:42 it approved Reagan couldn't get it
69:44 nobody could get it I got it all done it
69:46 was amazing they were getting ready to
69:48 start drilling the equivalent they think
69:51 of Saudi Arabia one of the biggest vines
69:53 in the world it was all set to go and
69:56 Biden comes in his one of his first
69:58 orders were we're not going to use it it
69:01 would have been so good for the we could
69:03 have supplied all of Asia with oil and
69:05 gas what was the what was the negative
69:07 and you talk about money right uh the
69:09 negative was politically they didn't
69:10 think it was good for them that's all
69:12 that's all it was so you don't think
69:13 that it's environmentally dangerous
69:14 taking it from way down deep in the
69:16 earth environmentally would have been
69:18 fine so it can be done responsibly
69:20 absolutely otherwi prot the environment
69:23 well I think windmills okay so they talk
69:25 about wind I think windmills are really
69:27 disruptive when you talk about the
69:29 environment they kill the birds you want
70:31 to see a bird Cemetery go under a
70:33 windmill someday that hasn't been
70:36 cleaned out with all the bird carcasses
70:39 you it's like massive amounts of bir
70:41 there a massive iore I I went to a ranch
70:44 in South Texas we had to drive past this
70:46 enormous windmill farm and it's gross
70:49 it's dystopian you're you're looking in
70:51 the left and the right all he seees
70:52 these big spinning machines that aren't
70:55 even that effective at generating
70:56 electricity corre most expensive form of
70:59 electricity is a windmill and then they
70:01 start to rust and rot and you have to
70:04 then they get abandoned by the people
70:05 that built them because well you have to
70:07 get rid of all that material too when
70:08 you replace those blades now you have a
70:10 problem because you have dispose right
70:13 you have to dispose these enormous
70:15 windmills and how they say you can't
70:17 bury them so I even question that but
70:19 I'm not going to get into it but they
70:21 say you can't bury the blades so you
70:22 have the blades and you can't bury the
70:24 blades you can bury the blades it's not
70:26 going to matter he can bury you'll find
70:27 areas you can bury but they come up this
70:29 is what I mean they come up with this
71:31 but the environmentalist dream is
71:33 windmills everyone you know what happens
71:35 to them after 5 years they start to rot
71:37 after 10 years you have to replace them
71:39 did you ever look at certain parts of
71:41 California where they have heavy
71:43 windmills and they've been abandoned and
71:45 they're all different manufacturers and
71:47 all different companies and they all
71:48 Haven seen that it is the ugliest thing
71:50 it looks like a graveyard almost a
71:52 graveyard of windmills uh it's pollution
71:56 bad it's it is it's it's no different
71:58 than leaving garbage on the ground how
71:00 about in New Jersey off the coast of New
71:02 Jersey they want to build the people are
71:04 going crazy not to build them but we you
71:07 have them the whales are washing up on
71:09 shore right so in 50 years they had one
71:12 whale come ashore now they had like 18
71:14 come in the last year what is the what
71:17 what is happening with the whales I've
71:18 read about this well they say that the
71:20 wind drives them crazy you know it's a
71:22 vibration because you have those you
71:23 know those things are 50 story building
71:25 some of them right and they're super
71:27 sensitive to vibrations they you know
71:30 the wind is rushing the things are
72:31 blowing it's a vibration and it makes
72:33 noise you know what it is I want to be a
72:36 whale psychiatrist it drives the whales
72:39 freaking crazy and something happens
72:42 with them but for whatever reason
72:44 they're getting washed up unsure and you
72:46 know and yet the environment ignored by
72:49 the envir environmentalist they don't
72:50 talk about it I think there's nothing
72:52 uglier I see it in Scotland I see it all
72:54 over the world you have this beautiful
72:57 Valley it's been there for you know in
72:59 Civilization thousands of years but
72:01 millions of years and all of a sudden
72:03 you have these ugly windmills up would
72:06 your plan to be replace that with
72:07 nuclear what Would You Do Well nuclear
72:09 is better I mean I I think there's a
72:10 little danger to nuclear but you know we
72:12 had some really bad nuclear they did one
72:15 in Alabama they did one in uh I think
72:17 South
72:18 Carolina they do them wrong they build
72:21 these massive things then the
72:23 environmentalists get in it I don't want
72:26 to go into a long story because it's too
72:27 long for the show this show is too
72:29 valuable to talk about concrete but they
73:31 have hardened concrete it's number 12
73:33 concrete it's the hardest it's harder
73:34 than steel it's incredible they put up a
73:37 wall and an inspector comes along those
73:39 nope nope you're a quarter of an inch
73:41 the wall might be 8 feet wide you're a
73:44 quarter of an inch too short I'm sorry
73:45 you got to rip down the wall you got to
73:47 because it's got to be poured
73:48 contiguously right you're one4 of an
73:51 inch I'm sorry I ripped down you can't
73:53 rip it down this stuff you can't put a
73:54 hammer through you can't it's it's
73:56 incredible concrete technology is
73:59 unbelievable what you know what's
73:01 happened you think of concrete you think
73:02 that's an example of overregulation
73:04 pointless well you have an inspector
73:06 that comes along and he says take down
73:07 a$ 25 zillion dollar W these things
73:10 ended up costing $25
73:13 billion and they one of them never got
73:15 opened but here's the story so France
73:18 does it France is largely nuclear and
73:22 they build small little compact plants
73:25 and if they need need more they build
73:26 the same thing and they hook it up and
73:28 they hook it up because they get too big
74:30 and too complex and too expensive and it
74:34 is very clean they say it's it's Absolut
74:37 you know my uncle I had a great uncle
74:39 who was a great genius just like other
74:42 members of my family but he was a
74:45 professor at MIT for I think 41 years he
74:49 was a longest show when I was in the
74:51 White House the head of MIT Princeton
74:54 and Harvard came down to me me and the
74:57 MIT person said I have a book on your
74:59 uncle Dr John Trump he was a longer
74:01 serving Professor he was a great genius
74:03 sir do you know how and he had uh he
74:06 knew everything about nuclear from math
74:09 to chemistry to nuclear he knew it and
74:12 he said someday it's going to be the way
74:14 to go but the problem is so dangerous in
74:16 terms of War he
74:19 said Donald some this was a long time
74:22 Uncle John Dr John Trump he said someday
74:26 you'll have a little Satchel at your
74:28 side and you go into a building and
75:31 you'll be able to blow up New York City
75:33 I said Uncle John that'll never happen
75:35 he's right you know he's right well that
75:36 was part of problem giving nuclear power
75:40 to other countries right like that was
75:42 the problem that happened with India and
75:43 Pakistan they got nuclear power and then
75:46 they were able to weaponize it the
75:48 biggest problem in the world today is
75:50 not global warming it's nuclear warming
75:53 and we have idiots that are negotiating
75:56 for us we have a guy that doesn't make
75:58 it past 4:00 and it's not because of age
75:00 you know they ought to I know so many
75:02 guys in their late 80s and they're
75:04 better than the I said to one guy the
75:05 other day I think you're smarter than
75:07 you were 25 years ago I've known him a
75:08 long time he's 89 years old he's sharp
75:11 as I mean he's
75:13 great Biden gives people a bad name
75:16 because that's not an old that's not an
75:18 age I think they say it because I'm
75:20 three or four years younger you know I
75:21 think that's why they say it they say
75:22 his age it's not his age he he's got a
75:24 problem major brain surgeries he did he
75:27 did those are not good operations and do
76:30 you see what he did today he went runed
76:33 towards the camera and made some apology
76:35 to na Native Americans and uh that he
76:37 said that's why he's headed out west
76:39 like he's off the reservation so to
76:42 speak for lack of a better term you know
76:44 it's interesting because during the
76:46 debate I was uh looking over I'm saying
76:50 this is strange just sort of like
76:52 strange things were happening yeah but
76:54 he couldn't keep it together but do you
76:56 think they knew he couldn't keep it
76:57 together do you think that they wanted
76:59 is that why like historically that
76:01 debate was earlier than they've been in
76:02 the past right I think they wanted to
76:05 get well there's a lot of theories a lot
76:07 of people said do the debate now and
76:09 we'll get them out right I think that
76:11 maybe could be well that is what
76:13 happened it's they also said do the
76:16 debate now and get it over with right uh
76:19 I don't think anybody thought he was
76:20 going to get out really I don't didn't
76:22 make any sense the debate the debate got
76:24 him out but but I think it's very unfair
76:26 look you have a bad debate his numbers
76:28 went down but I think she's not doing
77:31 very well right now and I think she
77:33 looks why want I get to that too because
77:35 it's hard to know like the whole poll
77:37 thing is very bizarre for most people
77:39 because most people don't answer polls
77:41 so they read the polls they're like
77:43 never I did hang up I was never called
77:45 by a PO if I did I wouldn't answer I'm
77:47 busy you know how polls are done oh I'm
77:49 going to get myself in trouble but so I
77:52 really don't believe too much in him so
77:54 well 2016 taught a lot of people about
77:56 the ineffective well they were very
77:58 ineffective because I thought I was
77:59 doing well I'd go to a place and I'd
77:01 have 30 40,000 people Hillary would go
77:04 they have 500 people and they tell me
77:05 I'm going to lose I said why am I going
77:07 to lose I had 40,000 people so she had
77:09 200 people but you know I have a theory
77:12 these pollsters they charge you a lot of
77:13 money too you know they charge you a
77:14 half a million bucks to do some stupid
77:16 poll and they interview like 251 people
77:19 I don't think they interview him in many
77:21 cases I don't want to get myself in too
77:23 much trouble think no I think
77:25 they sit there they make a deal they get
77:26 a half a million bucks and they say
77:28 Trump's leading 51 to 49 they announce
78:31 it and everybody says oh do you
78:33 understand I I don't think they I think
78:37 in a lot look I'm a very common sense
78:40 person I think that they probably don't
78:43 always Paul some of them probably never
78:46 pa uh what's the difference between 49
78:49 to 51 and 47 and a half well it's also a
78:53 tiny percentage of the population I
78:55 don't think it's representative of the
78:57 overall population I just don't think I
78:59 don't know of one person in my whole
78:01 life that ever got called by a puler
78:03 exactly that's my point so here's here's
78:06 my question but I shouldn't say that
78:08 because I'm doing very you know really
78:09 well in the polls but I think that so
78:11 this week I happen to believe in a verse
78:13 I only believe they're good no I like
78:16 them this month but no I I honestly
78:18 believe that this is probably a lot of
78:20 fraud I had a poll Washington Post ABC
78:23 in the Hillary thing on Wisconsin they
78:25 had me down 17 points the day before the
78:28 election I knew it was wrong because I
79:31 had a rally I had 29,000 people at a
79:33 racetrack and it was like Zer degrees
79:35 Wisconsin and they had me down 17 points
79:39 in other words you had no chance and I
79:41 won and I called up my pulsers good guy
79:44 good good guy and I I believe he's
79:46 legitimate and you know some of them are
79:48 some of them are I said tell me why did
79:51 they have me down so much I mean
79:53 nobody's going to believe him next time
79:55 they said they don't care when you're
79:57 down 17 points people are going to stay
79:60 home they're not going to vote because
79:01 they're going to say I love Trump but
79:03 I'm not going to waste my time it's cold
79:04 out I said but what do they make at four
79:06 or five he said at 4 or5 they're going
79:09 to go and vote at 17 they're not going
79:11 to go think of it I was s this is a
79:13 Washington Post ABC poll I was down 17
79:17 points in Wisconsin and I
79:19 won it's crooked stuff there's a lot of
79:22 crooked stuff and I wanted to talk about
79:23 that too because one of the things that
79:25 people um talk about with you is uh the
79:29 denial of the results and I think JD
80:31 Vance did a brilliant job the other day
80:33 when he was being interviewed uh and
80:35 they they asked him did Trump lose the
80:37 2020 election and he turned it around
80:39 and said was there legitimate election
80:42 interference in suppressing the hunter
80:44 Biden laptop story on social media and
80:48 was that a concerted effort well they
80:51 say make 10-point difference and I lost
80:53 by one one uh
80:55 tenth of a point is they say it was
80:58 22,000 votes but look it was much more
80:01 than that and I appreciate jdan saying
80:03 that and by the way I think he was a
80:04 great pick do you like JD as a I like
80:07 him a lot you're allowed to say that no
80:09 I do I like him a lot I think he's
80:10 brilliant guy and I think his ability to
80:13 talk like a normal human being he did
80:15 you did my friend Theo Von's podcast and
80:17 he just did it how did he do with he did
80:19 great and it he just talks like a normal
80:21 human being do is that why you called me
80:23 to do this no no
80:25 I was uh once they shot you I was like
80:28 he's got to come in here it's all about
80:30 timing it's all about the timing I think
81:32 timing's perfect do you even have a scar
81:33 on your ear you got anything on there I
81:35 do what me say say what you got so right
81:38 over here it's a tiny little Mark it
81:41 zied right there it's it healed up
81:44 pretty good well it's pretty
81:46 good yeah little it's not like uh some
81:48 of the wrestlers some of the UFC
81:50 fighters you didn't get no no it got it
81:54 was sort of like a top shot mhm the
81:56 point of the bullet was a little of the
81:58 but you see the the the thing's taken
81:60 off a little bit but uh it makes me a
81:03 tougher guy you know the fighters you
81:05 know the fighters love their you know Bo
81:07 nickel is a great fighter how's he going
81:09 to do I think he's Terri great he's a
81:11 fantastic he was almost like undefeated
81:13 in college he still yeah he's a
81:14 fantastic wrestler and one of the one of
81:16 the best Mixed Martial when is he
81:17 fighting again he's fighting in Mass
81:19 Square Garden in November oh that's
81:21 going to be an after the election yep so
81:24 I'll either go as president or I'll be
81:26 depressed and I won't bother I really
81:29 yeah I think they're having a fight
82:30 right now one of the things that was
82:31 fascinating also was uh the denial of
82:34 the election results is is a pretty
82:36 common thing Hillary Clinton famously
82:39 denied that she called you an
82:40 illegitimate president and she said that
82:42 Russia put you in place even though she
82:43 conceited yes you know she Conceited the
82:45 night of the election CU she was beaten
82:48 yes and it was a thing that was pretty
82:50 common for people especially Democrats
82:53 to deny the elections
82:55 there's been many of them the Bush
82:57 Administration the you know the dangling
82:59 Chads all that all that stuff well look
82:01 at these guys in Congress all these SAS
82:03 bags in Congress that are Democrats
82:05 they're still denying
82:07 2016 but now they don't so much because
82:09 you know they try and pin it on me you
82:11 don't hear them say here's my they
82:12 denied it right up until the end my
82:14 point is this idea of election fraud is
82:18 a forbidden topic and you get labeled an
82:21 election deny it's like being labeled an
82:23 antivaxer if you question some of the
82:25 health consequences that people have had
82:27 from the 19 shots oh my God you're anti
82:29 you're an antivaxer if you say and what
83:32 I say publicly and I've said this a lot
83:35 it's not
83:36 0% so if you ask me what is the amount
83:38 of election fraud in this country is it
83:40 0% no one thinks it's 0% I've never met
83:44 one person not a a super liberal
83:47 Progressive far left person or a a
83:50 right-wing conservative not one person
83:52 thinks it's 0% they think when you have
83:55 human beings and also you have a lot of
83:58 weirdness that was going on during the
83:60 2020 elections particularly with mail
83:02 and ballots and you had legislators that
83:05 had to approve and they didn't approve
83:07 and they went out and did it anyway and
83:10 you had ballot you had old-fashioned
83:12 ballot screwing I mean you had the you
83:15 have people going up and dropping in
83:17 phony votes you had unsigned ballots etc
83:19 etc there's certain people that think
83:21 they have and there's the rhetoric is
83:23 also that you're Hitler and that in
83:25 order to stop Hitler you have to do
83:27 whatever it Tak that was okay yeah yeah
83:29 and this is I mean you're hearing this
84:30 now K compared you to said Your Love of
84:33 Hitler yesterday it's you know KLA is a
84:36 very low IQ person she's a very low IQ
84:39 you know I'm for taking tests too I
84:41 think anybody that runs for president
84:43 should take they should give him test
84:45 and it's not an age thing it's not based
84:47 if you look back on History 70s and 80s
84:49 your greatest some of your greatest
84:51 leaders in the world world history
84:53 longtime world history they were in
84:55 their 70s and their 80s but I think you
84:58 should take cognitive tests I think
84:60 everybody they say it's
84:02 unconstitutional but I think ridiculous
84:04 I think Comm should have a test because
84:05 there's something missing there's
84:06 something wrong with her well I think
84:08 it's pressure I think the pressure and
84:10 the scrutiny you've been a celebrity for
84:11 a long time and you understand what this
84:13 is like but for someone who's in her
84:15 late 40s who becomes the vice president
84:18 who runs for president becomes the vice
84:19 president and then all of a sudden the
84:21 weight of the world is on your shoulders
84:23 and there's all these people paying a
84:24 lot lot of people clam up but you either
84:26 have it you don't correct look this is
84:29 an interview you've we've covered a lot
85:31 of territory right and and you know it's
85:33 fine I don't care I want to I think it's
85:36 much more interesting she to do an
85:39 interview with uh Al Anderson
85:42 Cooper a softball crazy softball
85:45 interview she took two days off and she
85:48 studied and studied all day long and
85:49 then she comes out with a result that
85:51 was a real embarrassment that was a
85:52 really bad interview she couldn't answer
85:54 a question question and every question
85:56 is not answered I mean like what would
85:59 you do your first day in office okay
85:01 I'll build a wall I won't build the wall
85:03 there's a hundred things you can say
85:05 just say anything right uh there's
85:07 something off with her well I also we're
85:10 dealing Jo we're dealing with the
85:11 smartest people they hate when I say you
85:13 know when the Pres when I call President
85:15 she they said he called president she
85:17 brilliant well he's a brilliant guy he
85:18 controls 1.4 billion people with an iron
85:21 fist I mean he's a brilliant guy whether
85:22 you like it or not and they go crazy
85:25 right it doesn't mean he's not evil or
85:27 it doesn't mean he's not yeah of course
85:29 dangerous but but actually we have evil
86:32 people in our country yes if you have a
86:34 smart president he can deal with Russia
86:36 he can deal with all of it I had a i
86:38 Russia would have never gotone into
86:40 Ukraine if I were president how would
86:42 you have stopped it he automatic two
86:44 things I told him I said Vladimir you're
86:47 not going in I used to talk to him all
86:49 the time you're not going in I can't
86:52 tell you what I told him because I think
86:54 it would be appropriate but someday
86:56 he'll tell you but he would have never
86:57 gone in but you know why else he
86:58 wouldn't have gone in oil prices at $40
86:00 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him
86:03 wouldn't have given him the money to
86:05 prosecute that war wouldn't have given
86:07 him the money I said it with President I
86:10 was with President she I said it was
86:12 almost the same conversation with
86:15 Vladimir was
86:17 Moscow with President she it was Beijing
86:21 it was almost the exact same
86:23 conversation I said don't do it he would
86:25 have never done it the day I left they
86:27 flew 28 bombers over the middle of
86:30 Taiwan 28 bombers and it's the apple of
87:33 his eye and the same thing with Russia
87:36 it's the Apple Ukraine is the apple of
87:38 his eye I used to talk to him I had a
87:39 very good relationship with him he
87:41 wouldn't have done it he would have
87:43 never done it but he also wouldn't have
87:45 done it because of the you know one of
87:47 the reasons that what happened is number
87:49 one he doesn't respect Biden at all not
87:52 even a little bit and who the hell would
87:54 but he doesn't respect him but when he
87:56 saw what happened in Afghanistan how
87:58 horribly that was handled number one you
87:01 take the soldiers out last not first
87:02 okay that was their big mistake and we
87:05 had that thing charted out and they
87:06 weren't obeying us they weren't uh Abdul
87:09 is the head of the Taliban boom boom he
87:12 had to do all these things some he
87:14 didn't do I said nope you're not do you
87:16 got to do them all this guy took he
87:19 immediately took all he left the
87:21 equipment behind 13 soldiers dead but he
87:23 took everybody out he took his soldiers
87:26 out before a child would know that's
87:29 where Millie was so stupid he was such a
88:31 stupid guy
88:32 Millie okay those generals should have
88:35 all been fired the Afghan the people
88:37 that were involved with Afghanistan
88:40 should have all been fired then they'd
88:41 be writing books about him how stupid he
88:43 was and bad he was but you take your
88:47 soldiers out last I had a a big rally
88:50 and I saw a child in the front
88:52 row uh about a year and a half ago and I
88:55 called the child up I said do you mind
88:56 if I borrow your child oh yes please and
88:59 they came up kids five years I gave them
88:01 quick details you know I said we want to
88:03 get out of this place and we have this
88:05 and we have this and we have the
88:07 equipment I gave him a little thing I
88:08 said do you take your soldiers out first
88:11 or last after everything's done you take
88:14 them out last sir a child would know
88:17 that we took our soldiers out first what
88:20 was your and we left a bag room well not
88:23 only that we left billions of dollars
88:25 worth of equipment and military vehicles
88:28 that they use for parades now best the
88:30 best equipment yeah to embarrass us the
89:32 best equipment in the world the Taliban
89:34 parade where there got tanks rolling
89:36 down the streets and Blackhawks flying
89:38 is the craziest thing I've ever seen
89:39 fact that we left all Best Equipment in
89:42 the World Behind what would you have
89:44 done differently well number one we
89:47 would have taken it out just so go back
89:49 a little bit further I had a couple of
89:51 conversations with Abdul and from the
89:54 time had those conversations cuz they
89:56 were shooting our soldiers you know with
89:57 the sniper stuff they were shoot they
89:60 were shooting a lot of them they were
89:01 shooting a lot with Obama much less with
89:03 me but they were shooting him and I said
89:06 get this guy on the phone the Press went
89:08 nuts when they heard this I had a great
89:10 conversation with it was a tough
89:12 conversation 18 months later there
89:14 wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at
89:17 and even Biden admitted it in a moment
89:19 of stupidity cuz he shouldn't admit it
89:21 his people went nuts he said yeah well I
89:23 will admit no Soldier we had we didn't
89:25 have a soldier killed in 18 months in
89:29 Afghanistan not one soldier was killed
90:32 because he understood what was going to
90:34 happen if that happened I didn't have
90:37 one so then when I left after having
90:40 gotten more votes than any sitting
90:42 president in the history of the country
90:44 and much more votes than he got in 2016
90:47 when I
90:48 left they started shooting our soldiers
90:51 but more importantly what they did is
90:54 they did that whole thing with you know
90:56 leaving he shouldn't have left number
90:58 one should have left from bogram because
90:60 bogram is this massive base it's got
90:02 tremendous acreage around it tremendous
90:04 it's a very big it was built many years
90:06 ago and part of the reason you wouldn't
90:08 have taken that is because it goes to
90:10 China one hour from where China makes
90:13 its nuclear missiles you should have
90:15 never left bogram number one they should
90:19 have left from bogram they should have
90:22 left last they should have got you know
90:23 we have Americans that are still there
90:26 they should have taken all their
90:27 equipment out everything should every
90:29 plane every screw should have been taken
91:31 out every tent and I said that that's
91:34 when I realized that Millie was a dummy
91:35 I said we're leaving but I want to get
91:38 everything out sirar it's cheaper to
91:40 leave it I said what do you mean cheaper
91:42 to leave it yeah he said it's cheaper to
91:43 leave it that was cheaper cheaper he
91:45 said it's cheaper sir not more dangerous
91:48 he just said cheaper I said I want every
91:51 plane I want every tank I want the
91:53 goggles they night goggles they have all
91:55 this stuff that these guys now have he
91:57 said sir it's cheaper to get out and
91:60 leave it I said so you think it's
91:02 cheaper to leave a $150 million brand
91:04 new airplane in there than it is to fly
91:07 it out with a tank of jet fuel and put
91:09 it in Pakistan or just fly it directly
91:12 back it's cheaper to live I said this
91:15 guy's nuts I'm telling you he was so
91:17 stupid he was so unwise he was like an
91:20 unwise man and there were a number of
91:23 them but I defeated Isis with the
91:26 greatest generals I had a guy who was so
91:28 great I flew to Iraq and I met the real
92:33 generals not these idiots that we deal
92:36 with and we knocked out you know I
92:39 defeated 100% of the Isis caliphate they
92:42 said it would take five years I did it
92:44 in a matter of a few literally a few
92:47 weeks and we hit them hard and he said
92:50 so we're going to hit him here we're
92:51 going to hit him there we're going to
92:52 hit him here there and I said this guy's
92:55 great I like this guy I was told it
92:57 would take five years that's why I went
92:00 I said how could it take five years we
92:02 have brand new Fighters we have the best
92:03 planes the best weapons the best guns
92:06 the best bombs how could it possibly
92:08 take that long and I flew to um I flew
92:12 and left at 3:00 in the morning nobody
92:15 knew I was going I got on Air Force One
92:17 and we started
92:18 flying and when we reached about half an
92:21 hour away from Iraq that was where the
92:24 air Port was big
92:25 airport uh about a half an hour away
92:28 they said sir I'm sorry you'll have to
92:29 turn off all your lights why we're
93:32 getting close to our site our land I
93:34 said you mean we spent 8 trillion do and
93:37 we can't leave the lights think of this
93:39 20 years $8 trillion and we can't leave
93:41 the lights on in a
93:43 plane I said that's okay turn the lights
93:45 on I'm not going to fight him that's one
93:47 this is because it's too dangerous yeah
93:49 too dangerous cuz they see the light up
93:50 in the air they'll shoot at it you know
93:52 so uh I said said turn the lights off
93:55 then they said sir we're going to also
93:56 pull your shades of that's okay said
93:58 that's okay the plane was Pitch Black
93:00 all the lights outside you know the
93:02 blinking they go the blinking Reds they
93:04 were all turned off and I like to sit
93:07 with Pilots a lot of times and these
93:08 guys are specimens I always say they're
93:11 better looking than Tom Cruz okay and
93:15 they're even taller like perfect
93:18 specimens these guys like for a fighter
93:20 you know you have some guys that are
93:22 perfect specimens these and you know
93:24 they picked they picked the best pilots
93:26 in the Air Force United States Air Force

94:32 and I'm sitting and and I'm feeling my
94:34 way up you know it's up high 7:47 so you
94:37 go through the stairs but I sort of knew
94:38 my way up there wasn't a light in the
94:40 plan I'm saying can you imagine we spent
94:44 trillions of dollars and we're trying to
94:46 fly in blind but I got into the plane
94:49 the cockpit is dark black little tiny
94:52 light you could see the pilot
94:54 a perfect looking human being his
94:56 co-pilot everybody was perfect they were
94:58 all like movie stars you know it's like
94:60 I could have cast a movie with these
94:01 guys and nobody would believe it because
94:02 they were too
94:04 good-look so I said how are we doing ke
94:06 sure we'll be landing in 10 minutes and
94:08 I look outside there's not a light and
94:11 I'm saying you know I've landed a lot of
94:13 planes I and you see like little lights

95:49 great profession everything it's incred
95:51 they're incredible these machines are
95:52 incredible he said sir we're fine no
95:55 problem sir I
95:57 said you know go I don't see the lights
95:60 up there Captain sure we're okay you
95:02 know so I mean I'm exaggerating a little
95:04 bit you know Pro problem with
95:05 exaggerating they'll tell the story
95:07 they'll say Trump was a coward so I'm
95:09 sitting with him he go 500 fo and I'm s
95:13 and I'm telling you there wasn't a light
95:14 on the
95:16 runway nothing and we're going in you
95:20 okay Captain everything good yes sir no
95:22 problem we'll be down at about 1 minute
95:24 sir and I'm telling you Joe you know
95:28 there's always a light there's not a
96:30 little pin and all of a sudden and you
96:34 hear bah bah Perfect Landing like glass
96:38 that's how good I mean these guys
96:39 between the equipment and it's genius
96:41 it's pure it was so dark you couldn't
96:44 see a thing there was no Runway you
96:47 wouldn't know where the hell you you're
96:48 in the middle of a desert and then I got
96:50 out of the plane I said thank you
96:52 Captain that's a great job and then I
96:54 get out of the plane and I'm going down
96:56 and I see a general and another General
96:60 and I see a staff sergeant a drill
96:02 sergeant and are various guys all
96:05 Central Casting Central
96:08 Casting they said sir would you like to
96:10 rest I said I don't want to rest I want
96:12 to figure out what the hell are we doing
96:13 with Isis I'm hearing we we can't it's
96:15 going to take years no sir we can do it
96:18 very quickly sir and anyway we go into
96:21 the room we go I mean Biden would have
96:23 taken nap for 4 days and then left
96:25 without a meeting so we go into the room
96:28 and these they have these guys I say how
97:30 long can you do it how long we can do it
97:32 in a couple of weeks sir I said wait a
97:34 minute they told me five years we can do
97:37 it in I don't he gave me a number like
97:40 like just like in no time I said why
97:43 haven't you done it because the orders
97:46 came in from Washington sir and they
97:48 would come here and tell us what to do
97:50 don't you challenge us we're not allowed
97:52 to do that sir that's not the military
97:54 way they tell us what to do and we have
97:55 to respect them I just so do you think
97:57 that it was incompetence why they didn't
97:00 go after Isis I think it's a bad system
97:02 you know when Mattis goes there or when
97:04 Millie goes there who's stupid and they
97:06 tell these guys that are actually smart
97:08 what to do and the guys that are smart
97:10 are saying we don't like what they're
97:12 doing but they're not allowed to sort of
97:14 counteract plus the guys that went there
97:16 are arrogant you know they're arrogant
97:18 fools they're like stupid fools uh the
97:21 way they pulled out of uh you know the
97:23 way they as an example the way they
97:25 pulled out of Afghanistan with the
97:27 people falling off the planes the it was
97:29 so it was it was worse than Vietnam with
98:32 the helicopters fall it was so bad there
98:35 was no reason for it anyway so we
98:37 knocked them out and I mean we have
98:40 great military we have great people but
98:43 not the television guys and I rebuilt
98:45 the military and then they gave a chunk
98:47 of it now I have to tell as much as it
98:49 is it's a tiny little piece believe it
98:52 or not we have an believe I rebuilt the
98:55 military I rebuilt our nuclear and in a
98:58 way I hated to redo it but I got to
98:00 realize how powerful that nuclear is
98:03 Joe one bomb Israel is gone but forget
98:08 one bomb could take out the entire East
98:10 Coast it's so bad and I watch these poor
98:14 fools talking about our oceans will rise
98:17 1 18 of an inch over the next 500 years
98:20 I mean we have people we have countries
98:23 right now you five countries and don't
98:25 underestimate North North if you take a
98:29 look at North Korea their new I was
99:31 there I mean I was with Kim I had a
99:33 great Rel I got along great with him you
99:35 know the president he got along that's a
99:37 good thing it's not a bad thing it's a
99:38 great thing Obama thought we were going
99:41 to go to war with North Korea when I met
99:43 with Obama just prior to the Takeover
99:45 you know you meet you have it's a sort
99:46 of a ceremonial meeting but it lasted a
99:49 long time a lot longer than it was
99:51 supposed to last I said what's the
99:52 biggest problem he said North Korea
99:55 by the time I finished I was we we had
99:58 no problem with North Korea we were
99:59 really it was a little tough at the
99:01 beginning remember MH he said uh I have
99:04 a red button on my desk I said I have a
99:07 red button also but mine's bigger than
99:09 yours and mine works I liked how you
99:11 called them little rocket man I said I
99:13 said yeah little rocket I said little
99:14 rocket man you're going to burn in hell
99:16 and it was a rough yeah oh so rough that
99:19 people were worried this is crazy and
99:21 then one day I got a call sort of like a
99:23 fight I got a call you know you ever see
99:26 what they pounding P then all of a
99:28 sudden but I got a call and it was from
100:31 him meaning his people they wanted to
100:33 meet they wouldn't meet Obama he tried
100:36 to meet they wouldn't even talk to him
100:37 about it and I think he expected to go
100:40 to war I actually do I believe he
100:42 expected to go and we check their
100:44 nuclear stock po it is substantial I
100:47 mean it's that's I said do you do
100:48 anything I got to know him very well I
100:51 got to know him better than anybody
100:53 anybody
100:54 and I said do you ever do anything else
100:56 why don't you go take it easy and relax
100:58 go to the beach you have beautiful beach
100:00 nice beach front property you know
100:02 kiddingly I said you're always building
100:04 nuclear just relax you don't have to do
100:06 it let's build some condos on your
100:08 Shoreline they actually have gorgeous
100:10 stuff and he said uh I just have to do
100:13 it because I need it for my safety ET
100:15 said I got to know him very well we had
100:17 no problem with him if you have a smart
100:20 problem if you have a smart really the
100:22 right president the smart president
100:25 you're not going to have a problem and I
100:26 say it to people we have a bigger
100:29 problem in my opinion with the Enemy
101:31 from within and it drives them crazy
101:33 when I use that term but we have an
101:35 enemy from within we have people that
101:37 are really bad people that I really
101:40 think want to make this country
101:42 unsuccessful when you look at what's
101:44 happening at our border Joe when you
101:45 have people coming in that when when
101:47 other countries are allowed to empty
101:49 their prisons into our country with
101:52 murderers we had
101:54 ,99 murderers dropped in our country
101:57 over the last three years and 15,000
101:60 rapists convicted rapists yeah drug
101:03 dealers drug lords that's just the ones
101:06 that have been correct people from
101:09 mental institutions what do you think
101:10 this hundred hundreds of thousands of
101:14 major criminals tougher and worse than
101:17 anybody we have these we're seeing the
101:19 consequences of it in San Antonio
101:21 they've taken over apartment buildings
101:22 in Aurora Colorado take apartment
101:24 buildings these Venezuelan G just the
101:26 beginning what what do you think the
101:29 strategy is you know one of the things
102:31 that they've said is that you uh stopped
102:34 a bill from being passed but didn't that
102:37 bill also include amnesty for the people
102:40 that are already here Jo this is years
102:42 after the fact the damage was already
102:45 done but what was the bill was the it
102:48 allowed 2 million people and they were
102:50 going to get amnesty it was a horrible
102:52 bill it didn't protect us at all but we
102:55 should just tell people what the
102:56 strategy is so one of the things that's
102:58 been their strategy one of the things
102:60 that's been very clear is that they've
102:02 moved a large percentage of these
102:05 migrants they're coming across the
102:06 border illegally they've moved them to
102:09 swing States like this is what's going
102:11 on with Springfield Ohio right they're
102:13 in swing States well that's not a swing
102:15 state I'm going to win Ohio by a lot so
102:17 that's not a but it's called Springfield
102:19 Ohio to be exact and yeah Springfield
102:21 Ohio is this very nice community of
102:25 52,000 people that just had
102:29 32,000 migrants that don't speak the
103:32 language dropped into their Community
103:35 you can't get into a hospital you can't
103:37 get into a school it's gone from a
103:39 beautiful little place to a horror show
103:43 and the mayor is a nice guy and the
103:45 mayor says we're looking for
103:47 interpreters I said no you've got to
103:50 remove them and bring them back to their
103:51 country mostly Haitians in this cas is
103:54 but they speak no they speak no language
103:56 they speak no no English mean in fact
103:59 even the language they do speak it's I
103:01 mean they can't get interpreters they
103:02 can't do anything and the mayor's trying
103:04 to be politically correct they're all
103:05 trying to be in Aurora Colorado you have
103:09 the the worst probably the worst gang
103:11 MS-13 might even be you know those two
103:13 are the worst gangs these are Venezuela
103:15 gangs they have taken over apartment
103:18 complexes and they're going to want to
103:20 take over the whole thing and you have a
103:22 weak Governor pathetic Governor uh who's
103:25 a radical left Democrat he doesn't know
103:27 what the hell to do but you have it in
103:29 many other communities but they don't
104:31 like to talk about it because it's you
104:32 know it's bad for the community to talk
104:34 about it these people have been LED in
104:37 here by this imbecile she's and I mean
104:41 it she's a low IQ person low IQ right
104:45 but it's also it's obviously not just
104:47 her there's there's a strategy that's
104:49 involved in letting these people she was
104:50 in charge of the Border well she's in
104:52 charge of the Border but they also they
104:54 they utilize that app the app that used
104:56 to be used it used to be used I think
104:58 essentially wasn't it for shipping
104:00 wasn't it when people were this country
104:02 it was used for shipping and now it's
104:03 used to deal with the cartels the cartel
104:07 heads of the cartel rich people by the
104:09 way these are loaded these people have
104:11 so much money they would call up think
104:13 of this they call up the app and the app
104:17 tells them where they should take their
104:19 load of illegal migrants from the Congo
104:23 you know we have a lot from the Congo
104:25 prisons in the
104:26 Congo um I made a little bit of a
104:29 sarcastic joke a man named Dana White
105:31 who you love who I love I assume you
105:33 love I love that dude I think he's in a
105:35 class by he's probably the reason why
105:37 you're
105:38 here I I I don't know maybe he's one of
105:42 the big ones he is the greatest guy you
105:44 know I always say every nobody's
105:46 indispensable you know everybody can be
105:48 replaced maybe you can't be you might
105:50 not be but they know what truly I don't
105:53 think you know the things they sold it
105:55 for 4 billion I said what a hell who the
105:58 hell is going to pay 4
105:60 billion and they made like a great deal
105:03 mean take him out I think it's all every
105:06 no he's the
105:07 best greatest guy he spoke at my at the
105:10 whole thing with you know I had just
105:12 been shot and he got up and he spoke so
105:15 better than anybody I mean who would be
105:17 better to introduce you I asked of all
105:19 the people and I know the biggest people
105:21 in the world and they all would have
105:22 loved to have done it I said Dana would
105:24 you do it you it was interesting he was
105:26 away and he said to the people that you
105:29 know one of my guys called said I won't
106:32 be able to do it I'm she I just left
106:34 with my wife and family I won't I said
106:37 he said no yeah I was a little surprised
106:38 even though I knew he was very far away
106:40 he was in someplace some you know and
106:42 and he deserved it with his family you
106:43 know the whole thing and then I said all
106:46 right that's let's and so we're look at
106:47 who we going to get and all of a sudden
106:50 she comes in sir Dana White just said
106:52 he's going to do it and he's coming back
106:54 in tonight he's taking you know the guy
106:56 is just a incredible guy and he's like a
106:59 tough Champion but loyal yeah he's got
106:03 to be one of your favorite people he's
106:04 one of my favorite love to death I've
106:06 been friends with him for 23 years I
106:08 love him so would you have um because
106:11 you're what you're doing here is
106:12 incredible I mean everybody tells me all
106:14 I know is today I'm going you know
106:16 you're and Joe Rogan people tell me like
106:18 I said I say how the hell do you know
106:20 that but it's it's sort of what you've
106:23 done here is amazing where would you be
106:25 if you didn't do the UFC stuff would you
106:27 have this show do you think yeah I would
106:28 still be doing it for sure yeah would be
107:31 the same would it be at the same level I
107:32 don't know but you would have it's hard
107:35 to know I think you know one of the
107:36 things that works for this show I guess
107:38 is that I I'm involved in so many
107:40 different things you know standup comedy
107:42 UFC and all the interest that I have
107:45 that lead to the podcast will you always
107:47 want to do you first of all you love UFC
107:49 I love it yeah you love the fights I
107:50 mean I watch you you are loving it they
107:52 could pay you nothing it'd be very they
107:54 didn't pay me anything for the first
107:55 like 13 shows I did it for free cuz they
107:57 were hammering money and I became
107:59 friends with Dana and my my position was
107:02 you're going to give me the best seat in
107:03 the house I get to sit cage side for the
107:06 fights I like I'll do it and I wanted to
107:08 help I was like I think these are the
107:10 guys that we had always hoped for in the
107:12 early days of the sport I started
107:13 working for the the company in 1997 I
107:16 was the before the UFC was purchased by
107:18 zua which Dana work for so I I was a
107:20 part of the previous owners and I only
107:22 did it for a couple years it was just
107:24 too much and I was losing money and it
107:25 was banned from cable because of
107:28 Budweiser and John McCain and you could
107:29 only get it on Direct TV and so and then
108:32 I came along and I gave him the S and he
108:34 loves you he never forgot it he he loves
108:36 you for that he talks about all the time
108:38 just interrupt you for one so he they
108:41 couldn't get a site because it was too
108:42 dangerous and everybody was against it
108:44 and they couldn't get license and I gave
108:46 him the first two or three sites and
108:48 they were great and by the way I went to
108:51 the first fight I said I never saw
108:53 anything like this it was crazy it was
108:55 so good take the best fight you've ever
108:57 it was like that fight right it was so
108:59 good that I gave it to him again again
108:01 and all of a sudden it caught on but you
108:03 know when I wasn't in Vogue you know
108:06 I've had time you probably never had a
108:08 time but I had times when I wasn't
108:10 exactly inv vog Dana they called him he
108:12 said he's the greatest guy there's
108:14 nobody like he said I'll never say
108:17 anything bad about that guy because when
108:20 I needed because they were having a hard
108:21 time at the beginning they almost pulled
108:23 the plug a couple of times right he said
108:25 he stood up and he gave us stuff that
108:28 nobody else gave us and nobody wanted
108:30 anything to do and he said I will never
109:33 and there was a time where it would have
109:36 been very popular for him to say bad
109:37 stuff about me he said the greatest
109:40 stuff about me he said you're going to
109:41 try and get me to say bad stuff about
109:43 Trump I'm never doing it he's a very's
109:46 an unusual guy very unusual guy he's a
109:48 fantastic guy a perfect guy to be at the
109:50 helm of something so controversial as
109:52 the UFC controversial now I mean well
109:54 now it's huge yeah well this was always
109:56 the thing that I would hop that it would
109:58 be I always knew that it was
109:59 unbelievably entertaining but I just
109:01 didn't know if maybe I was crazy maybe I
109:03 loved it because I've had this long
109:05 history of being involved in martial
109:06 arts and maybe like other people just
109:08 think it's too violent but can boxing
109:10 make it yeah boxing still a great sport
109:13 I love boxing but it seems to be so
109:16 unimportant Now by comparison to UFC
109:18 don't you think I think well you know
109:21 Dana is working with the the kingdom of
109:23 Saudi Arabia they're they're going to
109:25 start promoting boxing now and with Dan
109:27 at the helm of it I think boxing can
109:28 return because the thing is they want to
110:31 make fights that other PE maybe you know
110:34 promoters don't want to make because
110:35 they want to protect their fighter
110:37 controversial fights where you know it's
110:38 dangerous like you don't know this guy
110:40 could lose and so the Saudis they're
110:42 smart they just offer a tremendous
110:44 amount of money and they're putting
110:45 together Fighter fights that no one else
110:47 can put together they're doing that in
110:48 boxing if Dan is involved he'll probably
110:51 make it good you know the amazing thing
110:52 though the the in fighting no UFC
110:56 fighter they say has ever died and it
110:58 looks to me much more violent than bucks
110:01 many boxers have died isn't it
110:02 interesting and Dana tells me because
110:04 they take so many shots to the face yes
110:06 and there's also no other options to
110:08 preserve yourself to protect yourself so
110:09 if you get hit in a UFC fight you can
110:11 clinch you can try to take the fight to
110:13 the ground you get options also you
110:15 don't get allowed to get knocked down
110:16 and then get back up when you get
110:18 knocked down you're concussed and
110:20 generally you know if a guy's really
110:21 hurt they could be finished in in on the
110:23 ground and the fight's over if it's
110:25 boxing you have 10 seconds to get up you
110:28 get up your head kind of clears but
111:30 you're still in real bad trouble and
111:32 then you can kind of run away and
111:34 survive until the bell rings they're
111:36 only three minute rounds and then you
111:37 start again so you're getting repeated
111:39 punishment to the Head yeah you know and
111:41 then there's also the issue of guys
111:43 weight cutting you know which is a
111:44 problem with the UFC as well but weight
111:46 cutting in boxing has led to if you look
111:48 at deaths in boxing there's very few of
111:50 them in the heavyweight division most of
111:52 the deaths in box in or the lightweight
111:54 divisions because when guys dehydrate
111:55 themselves to to to lose weight to make
111:58 weight their brain is the last thing
111:60 that gets rehydrated like it's very
111:03 difficult to completely rehydrate
111:05 hydrate your brain quickly and you only
111:07 have 24 hours between the weighin and
111:08 the fight and it used to be the
111:10 weigh-ins were the day of the fight like
111:12 when when boom boom manini had a fight
111:14 with Duku Kim and killed him in the ring
111:16 which is one of the last ones on
111:18 television that we've seen that's right
111:19 that was a crazy event for people and
111:22 heartbreaking and it L to a bunch of
111:23 different changes and one of them is day
111:25 before we to allow people to rehydrate
111:27 better and the other one is they dropped
111:29 it from 15 rounds down to 12 which look
112:32 they should do that I you know I'm not
112:34 I'm not the fighter so but those 15
112:36 round fights were unbelievable they were
112:38 unbelievable un unbel you go back Golden
112:41 Age yeah in terms of entertainment oh
112:43 yeah those were the the championship RS
112:45 those were the greatest fights those
112:47 last three rounds were crazy I mean it's
112:49 such a war of attrition you know a lot
112:51 of people think even like a five round
112:53 UFC fight that the UFC is f minute
112:56 rounds it's so much energy you're
112:58 burning out and those last couple of
112:59 rounds those five round fights the
112:01 fourth and the fifth round unbelievably
112:03 brutal who's the greatest UFC fighter in
112:06 you are you allowed to say in your
112:07 opinion it's tough for you to say
112:08 because you do this but who do you think
112:10 is the greatest of the fighters there's
112:12 there there's a lot of arguments for
112:14 who's the greatest of all time you know
112:16 uh John Jones most people would say he
112:19 the greatest of all time never lost uh
112:22 it's a there certainly a really good
112:23 argument for that there's another
112:24 argument for George St Pierre uh I
112:27 always leave in BJ Penn in his prime
112:29 Anderson Silva in his prime um you know
113:32 Mighty Mouse people forget about Mighty
113:34 Mouse because unfortunately he's a
113:36 smaller guy he's 125 pounds flyweight
113:38 Champion he's one of the greatest
113:40 expressions of mixed martial arts I've
113:42 ever seen I think to this day what kabib
113:45 is fantastic but if you looked at like
113:47 accomplishments in terms of championship
113:48 fights kabib retired 29 and0 but he
113:51 didn't have as many
113:54 they say he might have lost to glaz and
113:56 Tau he might have lost to him might have
113:58 lost round and that was a controversial
113:00 fight where people think that glaz and
113:02 Tau could have even got the decision in
113:04 that fight I'd have to go back and watch
113:05 it again to make a decision but uh
113:07 they're great athletes oh the best
113:09 athletes in the world and the the most
113:11 dangerous sport in terms of like it's I
113:15 always call it highlevel problem solving
113:17 with dire physical consequences it's
113:19 just brutal that's what fighting is you
113:20 know I I never forget so there was a
113:23 fighter named James T Tony oh yeah I
113:25 love James Tony he fought as a very
113:27 light fighter and he ended up as a
113:29 heavyweight this guy went through
113:30 everything he was almost like a
114:31 lightweight he went from middleweight
114:33 all the way up to heavyweight yeah beat
114:35 holfield as a heavyweight and he was a
114:37 real fighter oh yeah so James Tony and I
114:39 think it was uh St George uh George St
114:43 Pierre St Pierre I think it was him who
114:46 did he fight James Tony no um James Tony
114:49 didn't fight George he fought a UFC
114:51 fighter yeah Randy cure fought James
114:53 Tony was it that was like an easy fight
114:56 that was a very easy fight Randy cotour
114:57 just took him down and it was the most
114:59 and he's half the size and he just once
114:02 he got to the ankles in fact the announc
114:04 said it's over yeah took him down
114:06 mounted him strangled him it was pretty
114:08 he was but he was talking big because he
114:10 was much bigger he was a pretty big guy
114:12 think James just wanted to make some
114:13 money and you think so but I never
114:15 forgot it it was over very quickly and
114:18 he was lying sleeping on the mat and he
114:20 was talking you know he was doing the
114:21 Muhammad Ali stuff but it didn't work
114:23 out but I remember the fight yeah that
114:25 was cure probably yeah it was cure
114:27 George never fought a boxer in an MMA
114:29 fight if he did he would kill him was he
115:31 was he one of the greatest yes
115:33 unquestionably that's the the argument
115:35 there's like a handful of guys you can
115:36 make the argument is the greatest of all
115:38 time people forget about Anderson Silva
115:40 in his prime he was Unstoppable it's but
115:42 that's the thing is and then there's
115:43 Fedor milliano who fought in Pride in
115:46 his prime he was Unstoppable there's
115:48 there's this and you have a couple now
115:49 that are pretty good oh we've got so
115:51 many now Alex Pereira
115:53 there's an argument that he's the topfor
115:55 fighter in the world now he's it's
115:57 unbelievable but it's like Fighters can
115:59 only compete at that level for so many
115:01 years and so my opinion you have to
115:03 judge them at their very Peak you can't
115:06 judge them when they're hanging on and
115:07 still fighting you can't judge them when
115:08 they're coming up you got to judge them
115:10 in that Championship peak in that
115:13 Championship Peak there's a handful of
115:15 guys that you would consider at the very
115:17 top if they stopped a little bit sooner
115:20 yeah some of them would have had you
115:21 know I mean there are a couple of that
115:22 you just mentioned without mentioning
115:24 names and they stopped they had the
115:26 perfect they were unbelievable and then
115:28 at a certain age they start getting
115:29 knocked out right yes it's unfortunate
116:32 but the thing is that same belief in
116:34 themselves that lets them become a
116:35 champion makes them think that they can
116:36 do it long past the time that they
116:38 actually can well Anderson Silva was
116:40 essentially unbeatable and then he lost
116:43 a CL one and then all of a sudden he had
116:44 no he got knocked out he got knocked out
116:45 by Chris Weidman right uh he was kind of
116:47 clowning in that fight famously and C
116:49 Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook
116:51 knocked him out and then they fought a
116:53 second time and he broke his leg on
116:55 Chris Weidman right that's right and
116:56 after that fight he was kind of never
116:58 the same because that that leg break
116:01 injury which Conor McGregor had there's
116:03 quite a few Fighters Wiman actually W up
116:05 having the same injury ironically
116:07 there's only been like you're never the
116:09 same cuz you can't kick never the same
116:10 well you can Weidman is still kicking
116:12 with that leg you can but
116:14 psychologically when you throw a kick
116:16 and your leg snaps in half and you're in
116:18 agony for a year right you have to get
116:20 surgery you have to get bolts and plates
116:22 keep your leg together and then it takes
116:24 forever for it to heal it always amazed
116:27 me how the kicker I mean you have those
116:29 cases but the kicker will do tremendous
117:32 damage to somebody's leg but their leg
117:34 doesn't seem to get damaged isn't it
117:35 sort of it does get damaged it hurts
117:37 more than you yeah but your shin you you
117:40 your shin gets very numb after a while
117:42 and guys that are really good kickers
117:44 they're kicking the thigh and they're
117:45 kicking the C they kicking soft areas
117:48 and they're slamming this hard numb Shin
117:51 their Shin gets all these like micro
117:54 fractures all over the shin and it
117:55 calcifies like these guys can kick
117:57 baseball bats you ever see them break
117:59 baseball bats with their Shins It's
117:01 Crazy some guys can do two baseball bats
117:03 someone will hold the baseball bat and
117:04 they just kick right through them I
117:06 watch your enthusiasm now right yeah and
117:09 it's like that's why you're good at what
117:11 that's why nobody does this better that
117:13 without the enthusiasm forget it well it
117:16 has to be authentic like that I mean the
117:18 only reason why I do MMA commentary is
117:19 cuz I I'm very interested in it for real
117:22 it's I'm not I don't have to manufacture
117:24 it I'm very interested so I and you love
117:27 going in there after the fight and
117:28 they're sweating all over you they're
117:30 slopping all over you you're B on
118:32 they're bleeding does that bother you a
118:34 little bit Yeah like two weeks ago with
118:36 a guy was he I never saw Round Tree yeah
118:39 he more stuff came out of his nose yes
118:42 it was pretty nasty but no I'm very used
118:44 to it I just wanted him to be able to
118:46 express himself you've done a great job
118:48 thank you you've done a great job so
118:50 back to you and back to what what are
118:53 you and first of all I love this idea of
118:55 you teaming up with Robert Kennedy right
118:57 and I love this make America healthy
118:59 again idea because there are chemicals
118:03 and ingredients and in our food that are
118:05 illegal in other countries because
118:07 they've been shown to be toxic there's
118:10 pesticides and herbicides and there's a
118:12 lot of that's been sprayed on our
118:14 food that really is unnecessary and
118:17 there's a lot of Health consequences
118:18 that people are suffering from a lot of
118:21 these things and to chart for you
118:23 beautiful because I had a feeling you'd
118:24 be asking me look at this chart these
118:27 are healthier countries look where the
118:28 United States is I'm going to send this
118:30 to RFK Junior look so this is uh well
119:34 something along the I was actually
119:36 talking to RFK today and he told me that
119:39 more than 70% of young men are
119:42 ineligible for the military because of
119:44 their health I could say it that's a lot
119:47 of it's obesity so here's the life
119:49 expectancy vers versus Health
119:51 expenditure same
119:53 yeah did you see that USA that's pretty
119:55 good Jam's the best he's very good he's
119:57 the best no but look at that look at the
119:60 US not good and that's our food that's
119:02 our diet that's that's sedentary
119:04 lifestyle that's our diet that's the
119:06 chemicals we ingest that's what that is
119:08 but RFK is going to be very you know I
119:11 think he's a great guy I I love the fact
119:13 that you guys teamed up and are you guys
119:16 are you completely committed to have him
119:18 a part of your Administration oh I am
119:19 but the only thing I want to be a little
119:21 careful about with him is
119:23 uh the environmental because you know he
119:25 doesn't like oil I love oil and gas I
119:27 think you know I think keep him out of
119:28 that to fire so I'm going to sort of
119:30 keep him out of a little I said focus on
120:32 health Focus you can do whatever you
120:34 want but I got to be a little bit
120:36 careful with the liquid gold you know I
120:38 understand um but listen there's plenty
120:40 of good work that could be done if you
120:42 focus on health here's the one that
120:43 here's the one that my all-time favorite
120:45 though see the arrow right here that's
120:47 what I left do you have anyone that is
120:50 pressuring you to not work with him have
120:52 have there been people RFK Jr there yes
120:57 I would imagine because financially he
120:60 could put it I would say that and you
120:03 know the I think in many ways they've
120:05 done a good job and many ways they've
120:06 done a bad job but I would say that the
120:09 uh big
120:10 Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard
120:13 that you don't have a Rel I've actually
120:15 always gotten along very well with him
120:17 I've known him a long time he's a
120:19 different kind of a guy he's very smart
120:21 great guy and he's very sincere about
120:23 this I mean he really is you know he
120:25 thinks we we spend a fortune on
120:27 pesticides and all this stuff and then
120:29 you end up with that chart is a terrible
121:31 chart the one previous it's such a bad
121:34 chart when you look at where we are
121:35 compared to other countries that don't
121:37 spend 10 cents so you know and you save
121:39 a lot of money but yeah we I've had some
121:41 people that aren't exactly
121:43 thrilled you can imagine right sure it's
121:46 a good question actually well certainly
121:48 if there have it doesn't affect me some
121:50 pharmaceutical drugs that have been
121:52 prescribed that have negative
121:54 consequences that these people have been
121:56 profiting off of and then you have a guy
121:58 like RFK Jr who spends an enormous
121:00 amount of time highlighting those things
121:02 you could say how they' be very
121:03 reluctant to have you support him I
121:05 would say that's an understatement yes
121:07 yeah so how what do you do to stop that
121:10 from getting in the way well look
121:12 they've come up with some amazing things
121:14 I mean I don't know how you feel I know
121:16 you're against the VAC certain vaccines
121:19 but like the polio vaccine people had
121:21 Polio they were it was like a
121:23 disaster and they came up Dr sulk and he
121:27 came up with a vaccine and there's no
121:28 polio now it very interesting there
122:31 hasn't been polio but now in the Gaza
122:32 Strip can you believe that have you
122:34 heard that there's been a big strain of
122:36 polio coming out in the Gaza Strip is it
122:39 vaccine derived polio because you know
122:41 there's there's a strain of polio that
122:43 comes directly from the vaccine because
122:44 unfortunately sometimes you vaccinate
122:46 people for poo see I haven't heard that
122:48 yeah yeah I mean all I can do is I sit
122:51 down and listen to him and and I'll give
122:54 it a total I would love him to be right
122:57 because it's if he's right it's a lot
122:59 less expensive generally there two
122:00 things that people point to when they
122:02 point to uh the the dangers of uh the
122:06 pharmaceutical drug industry one thing
122:08 is when pharmaceutical drugs were
122:10 allowed to advertise on television we're
122:12 only one of two countries in the world
122:14 that allow pharmaceutical drugs to
122:16 advertise on TV the other one's New
122:18 Zealand but they're they're more
122:19 restrictive than we are people are those
122:21 ads Those ads you hear like you know
122:23 take a certain drug and then you hear
122:24 all theen it causes cancer and boldness
122:27 we don't like boldness this and that and
122:29 iight and you can lose your vision and
123:31 you know I just I actually asked one of
123:33 these guys I would never take I me
123:36 because there's things that are so bad
123:37 they go through a whole list I guess
123:39 they save some liability but man I said
123:42 does that affect the purchase and they
123:44 say it really does when they when
123:47 there's something you have and you read
123:49 and then they go through the list of
123:51 side effects potential side it's not
123:53 even the potential side effects I mean a
123:56 lot of people are just I I asked that
123:58 question people hear that when I hear it
123:01 I I'm going to take a p that says may
123:03 affect your vision may cause blindness
123:06 may this yes and but well I know you're
123:08 aware of call and Casey means right yes
123:10 well one of one of the things that they
123:12 pointed out and this is a very important
123:14 thing for people to understand is what a
123:16 lot of these drugs do is they they act
123:20 to to some or another mitigate the
123:23 effects of poor metabolic Health uh but
123:26 most of these problems that these people
123:28 are suffering from wouldn't exist if we
123:30 put an emphasis on metabolic Health if
124:32 people got healthier they started eating
124:34 nutritious food and taking vitamins a
124:37 whole host of these problems that people
124:39 are having would go away and the problem
124:42 with that from the pharmaceutical drug
124:43 standpoint is they wouldn't be able to
124:44 sell drugs to these people and this is a
124:47 fear the pesticides and things like that
124:49 on the plants and the what do you think
124:51 of that it's terrible well I think
124:53 regenerative agriculture unfortunately
124:55 is very difficult to scale to a point
124:57 where you got a Jack In The Box on every
124:59 corner that's right if everybody wants
124:60 food and we have food deserts and we
124:02 have places like Los Angeles where no
124:03 one's growing anything and everything
124:05 has to be shipped in and it's very
124:07 difficult to feed that many people we've
124:09 created this incredible Society where we
124:12 have these enormous cities but it's in
124:14 it's very difficult to get food to these
124:16 people and then for a lot of these
124:17 people in lowincome areas the only food
124:20 that's available is cheap unhealthy F
124:22 that's right and we could fix that that
124:25 that's if we could send $175 billion to
124:28 Ukraine we could do something to fix a
124:30 lot of the health problems that the
125:31 United States has and I think it would
125:34 it would help us as a nation overall
125:37 just if you just put it out there that
125:39 hey as a nation we're going to make a
125:41 concerted effort to get people healthier
125:43 just put it out there and people start
125:44 making better choices well when you look
125:46 at that chart I I was I just they just
125:48 gave me that chart because they said you
125:50 may want to discuss this topic which I
125:52 know is a big topic for you and when I
125:54 looked at that chart and I looked at how
125:56 unhealthy we are as a nation that's a
125:58 that's a pretty big thing how are you so
125:00 healthy is it golf no it's genetics I
125:04 believe you know I'm a big gentics has a
125:05 big factor I really am I mean my father
125:08 was uh unfortunately it is a big factor
125:11 for health some people are just way more
125:13 robust but you do play golf a lot and
125:15 that is both of my parents it it's for
125:18 me it's good fres it really is it's
125:20 fresh you're outside um
125:22 even mentally you're focused on that
125:24 three-footer and for some for a couple
125:26 of hours you're not and I go quick I
125:28 play Fast real fast and I'm I'm in I'm
126:30 out but you know it gives me I was never
126:33 one that could like run on a treadmill I
126:35 just and I can do it you know when
126:36 passing a physical they asked me to run
126:39 on a treadmill and then they make it
126:41 steeper and steeper and
126:43 steeper and the doctor said it was at
126:45 Walter re they said it's unbelievable I
126:48 could have got I'm telling you I felt I
126:50 could have gone all day but I I said doc
126:53 I can do this all day long I'm not I
126:55 have no problem but it's boring to me do
126:58 you understand it's just boring golf's
126:59 exciting but I did it for so long they
126:02 couldn't believe it that I did it and I
126:04 never you know I don't do it I don't
126:05 really you know I have friends who run
126:07 in this stuff all day long but I had no
126:09 problem doing it but it's really boring
126:11 so with with golf or something you know
126:13 or tennis or whatever but golf as you
126:16 get older there's something really good
126:18 about it and you have competition with
126:20 yours
126:22 it's a great handicap Sport and it's
126:24 also a thing I think that's uh it cleans
126:26 your mind because when you're looking at
126:28 a a shot that's all you can think of
127:31 when you're executing it gives you a
127:32 couple of you know it's interesting like
127:34 with tennis if you're much better than
127:36 somebody you can't really play with
127:38 somebody you know it doesn't work you
127:39 can give them sort of the equivalent of
127:41 Strokes right but it's not the with golf
127:44 you can play with a lousy guy and give
127:46 him a stroke a hole or two strokes a
127:47 hole or something you know it's a good
127:48 handicapping sport but it gives me a
127:51 little exercise but I haven't played uh
127:52 in a long time I won a lot of I won 32
127:55 Club championships can didn't you play
127:57 right after you got shot uh no where I
127:00 what I did is I played with Bryson D
127:03 Shambo do you know Bryson yes the pro
127:06 uhhuh he's a great player and we played
127:09 it was a certain thing that we played I
127:11 guess called breaking 50 or something 50
127:13 we play From a Certain te and if you can
127:16 break 50 and it got tremendous ratings
127:19 sort of like a crazy thing it got he's a
127:22 great guy but wasn't that like a couple
127:23 of days after you got shot I don't know
127:26 I I know I that was one of the funniest
127:27 things you were on the golf course I
127:29 think I did yeah maybe I did but I you
128:32 know I view it very interestingly I'm
128:35 running for president of the United
128:38 States to me it's such a big deal it's
128:40 so important so I've got now the biggest
128:42 deal in the Free World it's it's a
128:44 hundred times bigger than the Super Bowl
128:46 and it's one person yeah so you're down
128:48 to two people and we start off at 9
128:53 billion cuz you have nine PE 9 billion
128:56 they say in the world who knows what
128:57 that number is but you get down to 350
128:00 million sadly we have no idea what we
128:02 have in this country but let's assume
128:03 it's 325 350 and you're down to two
128:07 people it's a biggest thing in the world
128:10 and when I heard she took off yesterday
128:12 and she took off the day before and
128:13 she's going to take off tomorrow or the
128:15 next day I haven't taken a day off in
128:18 56 days that's a long time I haven't
128:21 taken one day off I don't I didn't I
128:24 don't want to play golf this is too
128:26 exciting golf is great but this is too
128:29 exciting this is more exciting than
129:30 anything you can do and the also it's
129:32 the home
129:33 stretch it's the home stretch who would
129:35 take a day off so we have 11 days left
129:38 now and think of it so I think I've gone
129:42 54 55 days in a row no days off and I
129:45 make speeches often times you know
129:47 sometimes not but I make speeches and
129:49 when you make a speech am my speeches
129:52 last a long time because of the weave
129:54 you know I mean I weave stories into it
129:55 and if you don't if you just read a
129:57 teleprompter nobody's going to be very
129:59 excited you got to weave it out so you
129:02 but you always have to as you say you
129:03 always have to get right back to where
129:04 yeah otherwise it's no good but the
129:06 weave is very very important very few
129:08 Weavers around but it's a big strain on
129:12 your you know it's a big it's a lot of
129:15 work it's a lot of work uh you got to be
129:17 careful of the voice you can lose that
129:19 voice The Voice wasn't designed I said
129:21 today so I made a big one last night I
129:24 was in Las Vegas big one the night
129:28 before in Arizona big one I mean they're
130:31 all big we have the there's never been
130:33 anything like it in terms of crowd never
130:35 been close never been close they say he
130:39 talks about crowd says you know what's
130:40 very interesting so we get crowds that
130:44 are really big and I say you know I've
130:48 never had a story because I don't get
130:50 good press I don't think I've had a good
130:51 story in years I really don't I don't I
130:53 swear I don't think I you you were
130:54 talking about it a little bit with Oprah
130:56 everybody loved me I don't think I
130:59 became president of the United
130:01 States I did great the second time I did
130:04 much better I I don't want to get you in
130:06 in any disputes but I won that second
130:09 election so easy and not just because of
130:11 but let me let me get to that let's I
130:13 want to talk to you about that but
130:14 here's the thing I did that and now I've
130:16 gotten the nomination again and don't
130:18 forget to get these nominations you go
130:20 against very smart people Ronda Sanz was
130:22 hot got to go through him uh Nikki Haley
130:25 was hot had to go through her I went
130:27 through everybody record time right
130:30 record time I got three nominations a
131:33 row uh won the first time did much
131:36 better the second time you know I get
131:38 millions of votes more the second time
131:40 and now I'm doing it a third time and
131:43 and it's an incredible thing I never get
131:45 a good story I only get bad press now I
131:49 will say this it's a lot easier if
131:51 you're a Democrat if I were a Democrat
131:53 you get a lot of positive PRS I would
131:54 get a lot of positive PR no it's a it's
131:56 a creepy corrupt business and the the
131:58 media to a large extent acts as a
131:01 propaganda arm for the Democratic party
131:02 it's not it's not even believable yeah
131:04 it's believe I mean it's bizarre to
131:06 watch and mo you know most young people
131:09 I think are aware of it I think most
131:10 Boomers still unfortunately read the
131:12 newspapers and believe in CNN but it's
131:15 getting younger let me tell you it's
131:17 getting for us for a conservative and
131:20 you know I don't myself the Internet
131:23 it's cuz the internet's giving people
131:24 information that they're not getting
131:25 from anywhere else and they like the the
131:28 very fine people hoax the Russia gate
132:30 hoax all these different things they've
132:31 done they tried to pin on you that's
132:33 like it's a clear Distortion of what you
132:36 actually said the blood bath hooks I was
132:38 talking about the Auto industry it's a
132:42 blood bath because Japan and and China
132:45 are taking our Auto and I said it's a
132:48 blood bath they said ah he used the word
132:50 blood bath think it's going to be a
132:52 blood bath because they're going to take
132:53 over that's exact terrible thing they do
132:55 but that's the problem with propagandist
132:58 cuz they take things out of context and
132:59 of ultimately what they do is they
132:01 diminish their own credibility because
132:02 people don't want to listen to anymore
132:04 because they see that they've done that
132:06 and they recognize what's going on and
132:07 they feel insulted they're intelligence
132:10 well look at the ratings you know shows
132:12 like yours so I have a son who's very
132:14 smart and Tall Barren right and he knows
132:19 all about you he knows about guys I
132:21 never heard of he said dad you don't
132:23 know how big they are they're big you
132:25 tell me how big I said who the hell is
132:27 he like Ross I Did he said Daddy's a
133:30 great guy I mean guys that are doing
133:33 it's a whole new world out there it's a
133:35 different world and I think you know I'm
133:36 I'm on Tik Tok now congratulations and
133:38 I've done really well no but you know
133:40 the crazy have you seen the numbers
133:43 billions like billions of hits it's
133:46 crazy I'm sure Tik tok's a wild
133:48 application and I've gone up 30 points a
133:51 Republican is always down 30 with young
133:53 people I'm plus 30 and I'm on T Tik Tok
133:58 it's had a huge impact young people are
133:00 rejecting a lot of this woke
133:02 young people are tired of being yelled
133:04 at and scolded they're they're tired of
133:06 these people that they think are
133:07 mentally ill telling them what the moral
133:10 standards of society should be today
133:12 people are upset it's a big there's a
133:13 big difference now even in just a couple
133:16 of years I was shaking hands with people
133:18 they young people the rebels are
133:20 Republicans now they're like you want to
133:22 be a rebel you want to be punk rock you
133:24 want to like Buck the system you're a
133:26 conservative now that's the that's how
133:28 crazy and then the Liberals are now
134:32 Pro pro- silencing criticism they're
134:35 they're Pro censorship online they're
134:38 they're talking about regulating free
134:40 speech and they regulating the First
134:42 Amendment it's bananas to watch Joe they
134:45 come after their political opponent well
134:47 they I got more guys I always say you
134:50 know I kid but I'm not kidding I've been
134:53 investigated more than alons Capone he
134:55 was the meanest of them all he'd kill
134:57 you in two seconds if he didn't like you
134:58 right I've been under investigation more
134:01 than alons Capone only because it's
134:04 political opponent stuff and I've won I
134:06 won the big case in Florida I I'm
134:08 winning the other stuff you win but you
134:11 know what they did they did something
134:12 that's only done in third world
134:14 countries they came after their
134:15 political opponent I could have put
134:17 crooked Hillary in jail well not only
134:19 that but they're they weaponizing it by
134:21 saying that that's what you're going to
134:23 do once you get in office ignoring what
134:26 they're doing right now it's crazy I
134:28 heard it somebody was defending me today
135:30 say no that's they say that's what
135:32 you're doing to him they're going he's
135:35 going to put us in jail he's going to
135:36 invest they said what you're that's what
135:39 you're doing to him a lot of people say
135:41 will you do that will you do that to him
135:43 if to them if you win you know it's the
135:46 presidency has tremendous power I could
135:49 have put crooked Hillary I respected
135:51 that you didn't because what you said
135:52 was it would be bad for the country no I
135:54 can't I couldn't even imagine you have
135:56 first of all Secretary State but more
135:58 importantly the wife of the president of
135:60 the United States of America going into
135:03 jail and if you ever saw when I'd say
135:05 something about her they all say I
135:07 didn't say it I never said it they say
135:09 lock her up lock her up and I'd always
135:11 go take it easy just relax we're going
135:13 to win this thing take it easy take it
135:15 easy and I'm telling you I kept it down
135:17 just the opposite now they say oh Trump
135:19 wanted to put her in jail no I saved her
135:22 from going to jail they had more stuff
135:24 on her and Comey had it because when
135:26 Comey got up and he stupidly because
135:29 he's a stupid guy too he goes a he's a
136:31 stupid son of a he got up Joe he
136:35 got up and instead of saying she's
136:37 innocent of all charges he went over
136:39 each charge and each charge was a killer
136:43 and he go and as far as her doing
136:46 this she's innocent and this and then
136:49 she's only a unfair Pro secutor for
136:52 would go but every time you heard these
136:54 charges they sounded so bad they were
136:57 bad and all it was is he wanted more air
136:00 time if he would have gone up and said
136:04 I've thoroughly investigated Hillary
136:07 Clinton and she's done nothing that we
136:09 feel is wrong it would have ended
136:11 instead he wanted to be up there because
136:13 he's a he's a PR Hound he's a hog and he
136:17 starts going through the and you know
136:18 what he had they had a huge problem
136:21 because FBI is great the people there
136:24 not the top people the people the real
136:27 people the people that work there it's
136:28 like the real generals that I told you
136:29 about that defeated Isis in record time
137:32 the FBI guys are great I'll bet you I'd
137:34 be at 95% in the FBI I bet that's right
137:39 underneath yeah and and so here's the
137:41 thing so he goes with Hillary and
137:42 instead of just saying he goes through
137:45 each charge right and even I was saying
137:48 man those are bad charges sounds
137:50 terrible cuz
137:51 those chares don't forget this is before
137:53 I got there now he was trying to protect
137:55 her but he did her a great disservice
137:58 because he wanted attention he was
137:59 stupid so I want to I want to talk about
137:01 2020 because you said over and over
137:03 again that you were robbed in 2020
137:06 totally what how do you think you were
137:08 robbed everybody always cuts you off I'm
137:10 G to allow well they not only cut you
137:12 off well what I'd rather do is we'll do
137:14 it another time and I would bring in
137:16 papers that you would not believe so
137:18 many different papers
137:21 that election was so crooked it was the
137:23 most crooked election okay but give me
137:25 some examples of how well let's start
137:27 let's start from the top and the easy
137:29 ones okay they were supposed to get
138:31 legislative approval to do the things
138:34 they did and they didn't get it in many
138:36 cases they didn't get it what things
138:38 anything legis approval like for
138:41 extensions of the voting for for for
138:43 voting earlier for this all different
138:45 things by law they had to get
138:47 legislative approvals you don't have to
138:49 go any further than that if you take a
138:52 look at
138:53 Wisconsin uh they virtually admitted
138:57 that the election was rigged robbed and
138:60 stolen they wouldn't give access in
138:03 certain areas to the ballots because the
138:06 ballots were in signed they weren't
138:08 Originals they were we could go into
138:11 this stuff we could go into the ballots
138:12 or we could go into the overall I'll
138:14 give you another one are you going to
138:15 present this ever uh like do you do you
138:20 think like just give you one more
138:22 before 51 intelligence Agents come up
138:27 that the laptop was from Russia it
139:31 turned out to be totally false 51 Former
139:34 Intelligence agents right they say that
139:35 made I don't believe it's this much but
139:38 it doesn't have to I won by like I lost
139:40 by like I didn't lose but they say I
139:43 lost Joe they say I lost by 22,000 votes
139:47 that's like one tenth of 1% less than
139:50 that it's a tiny little thing 22,000
139:53 votes spread over the that's spread over
139:56 this this period so 51 intelligence
139:60 agents lied they lied they lied they
139:03 knew it was it was Hunters it was from
139:06 his bed it was Hunter's laptop they said
139:08 it was created by Russia Russia Russia
139:12 it was the Russia hooks the Russia hooks
139:14 was a big HX it was all a big hook so
139:16 well that's clear one example that is a
139:19 good examp that's a big example they say
139:20 it made a 17o difference that's a big
139:23 example but that's only one and you can
139:26 go into the ballots where they wouldn't
139:28 give you access to the ballots you could
140:30 go into the ballot harvesting you could
140:33 go into $500 million for the lock boxes
140:37 but just in terms of narrative so
140:38 there's two things right there's the
140:39 Russia hoax there's the collusion with
140:41 Russia that was never proven right
140:43 that's one well it no it's proven it
140:45 didn't happen right right but but they
140:47 they talked about it on telev two and a
140:49 half years to prove but not only that
140:51 but it was a constant narrative on
140:53 television so that's a constant
140:55 narrative that gets into people's minds
140:56 especially lwi information people that
140:58 just watch the news that you're in
140:59 collusion with Russia so that's one so
140:01 that changes the narrative and then you
140:03 have the 51 Former Intelligence agents
140:05 that work with the original Twitter and
140:09 get them to remove links you can't share
140:11 it on DMS you cannot share that story
140:13 they they swept that story because they
140:15 said it was Russian disinformation even
140:17 though they knew it was not so that's
140:20 two examples that are real examples now
140:23 anyone who considers himself a
140:25 legitimate objective Observer of
140:28 American politics if you really want the
141:30 best person to win you would want people
141:33 to not lie and the only reason why they
141:36 got away with this lie was because they
141:38 continually labeled you as this horrible
141:41 threat to democracy and Hitler they kept
141:43 saying you're going to be a dictator
141:45 ignoring the fact that you wer a
141:47 dictator for the four years where you
141:49 actually the president I was actually
141:51 the opposite of a dictator I was a very
141:53 straight guy but look those three things
141:55 you take those three things each one of
141:57 them by themselves causes the result to
141:59 be different okay it does and then you
141:01 can go into a hundred other things there
141:03 are so many we can't have corrupt
141:06 elections and we can't have open borders
141:08 we need a we need you need to have a
141:10 country you need borders you need Fair
141:13 elections and I'll tell you the other
141:15 thing you need is you need a free and
141:17 fair press one of the things I like
141:19 about doing a show like this can can you
141:21 imagine kamla doing this show I could
141:23 imagine her doing lay she be laying on
141:26 the floor she was supposed to do it and
141:28 she might still do it and I hope she
141:29 does I will talk to her like a human
142:31 being I will try to have kind of an
142:33 interview with you I hope she does
142:36 because it would be a mess she'd be
142:38 laying on the floor com she' you'd be
142:40 saying call in the Medics I think we'd
142:42 have a fine conversation I think I'd be
142:44 able to talk to her I wouldn't try to
142:46 interview her I just try to have a
142:47 conversation with her and hopefully get
142:48 to know her as a human being that was my
142:50 goal
142:51 having her on trying to get her to
142:53 express herself just as I don't know if
142:54 these I don't think these formats are
142:57 good I don't think that two people first
142:59 of all I hate the idea of the
142:01 presidential debates because I hate the
142:02 idea of a Time limitation on complex
142:04 ideas also you have to break I think you
142:07 have to have the debates to right but
142:08 the way they do the debates I think is
142:10 the wrong way to do it I think they
142:11 should have a conversation I think you
142:14 and comma you sit across a table with no
142:17 one in the room but the two of you of
142:19 course you're not going to shout each
142:21 other of course you're not going to
142:22 insult I mean it may get they used to it
142:25 wouldn't but that would be the way to do
142:27 it they used to do it that way cameras
142:29 on you with no no one interfering with
143:32 press with with checking whether or not
143:35 it's factual especially when it's biased
143:37 because they checked you all those times
143:39 and they didn't check her with clearly
143:41 things that were inaccurate right so
143:44 have two people just have a conversation
143:46 with without a time constraint and also
143:48 this idea they cut off the the the
143:51 microphone no crowd no crowd crazy too
143:54 because you're good at working a crowd I
143:55 would rather have a crowd of course you
143:57 would you're good at crowds but I had no
143:59 so they gave me an alternative I don't
143:01 think he wanted to debate why did they
143:02 want no crowd what was the AR I think
143:04 they thought I wasn't going to accept it
143:05 so I believe what they wanted to do is
143:07 have me not accept so they gave me a
143:10 deal I couldn't refuse and I said I'll
143:13 do it okay it's like the mob right I'll
143:16 take it so they came to me they said
143:19 we'll debate Joe Biden you know that
143:21 thing got tremendous ratings to that was
143:23 crazy but we'll debate Joe Biden but you
143:26 can't have a crowd they also wanted
143:29 sitting down I said that's the only
144:31 thing I said look you got to you got to
144:32 stand up you can't really sit down you
144:34 know in the old days they did sit down a
144:35 little bit but but he gets tired you got
144:37 to stand up and they agreed to it it was
144:40 a very tough thing it almost killed it
144:42 they wanted to they wanted to have like
144:44 desks we we sit I said I think we should
144:47 stand up and that was the only thing I
144:49 asked for I said we got to stand up
144:51 I I thought it looked bad for like the
144:54 public but they said no crowd and cut
144:57 off the mic and I said I can live with
144:60 it I mean I could live with it and they
144:02 thought I was going to reject it and
144:03 then they would say he didn't want to
144:05 debate sleepy Joe right that's what they
144:08 thought was going well they tried to say
144:09 that with you and KLA as well they tried
144:10 to say that you didn't want to debate
144:11 her as well no by the way with her
144:14 number one I'm leading number two you
144:15 know I didn't they also said it with the
144:17 primary so I
144:19 had like 10 12 guys right in the primary
144:23 no stupid guys I mean you know they
144:25 Governors and they Center they're not
144:26 stupid people some are stupid but not
144:28 all of them and all my guys said you
145:31 have to be in the debate I said why I'm
145:33 leading by 74 points the closest guy to
145:37 me I'm I'm like 60 points 70 points
145:39 higher why would I stand there like an
145:42 idiot for two hours and let every one of
145:44 them scream at me I'm going to be the
145:45 focus what right and I said I'm not
145:48 debating and it was a very smart thing
145:50 because you know
145:51 it was they just killed themselves the
145:52 Republican primary yeah the Republican
145:54 primaries um with I like debating I
145:59 think de I think you have to debate but
145:01 I like I like debating the like the
145:03 Rosie O'Donnell debate I like debating
145:06 when you have a g remember the rosie
145:08 funny crazy thing Megan that was a hell
145:11 of a question man if I didn't come up
145:13 with that answer well what it was is you
145:16 know that was we had 28,000 people that
145:19 was the Cleveland Arena where the
145:20 Cavaliers played right LeBron James I'm
145:22 not a big fan of LeBron James but he is
145:24 a good basketball player but you know
145:26 that was the and when I said that the
145:29 place went crazy and she kept talking no
146:33 she had like 10 other yeah well Megan
146:35 said you said it to other people and you
146:36 admitted you did but it was funny it was
146:38 it was a comedic timing moment it was
146:40 fun that's what they wanted it was lucky
146:43 I did it because she was drown oh she
146:45 wasn't F that question but she kept
146:47 talking but you couldn't hear to this
146:49 day they don't know what she said but
146:50 wasn't buzzing so anyway but we had a
146:53 good time I it's comedic timing and
146:54 that's the reason why to have a debate a
146:56 debate in front of a large audience and
146:57 then they prob Smith dinner I got very
146:60 good reviews on that great that was
146:01 great it was very funny very funny stuff
146:03 the Tim wall stuff was very funny Tim
146:05 wall yeah he's funny that's a real be
146:07 that's a crazy one she the she said that
146:10 she had picked him and this one of the
146:11 question I want to ask her when she was
146:12 sleep deprived she said she was uh
146:15 suffering from sleep deprivation when
146:16 she picked him which is just I was he
146:19 maybe take a nap so I
146:21 okay look let's see how it all turns out
146:22 I think we're going to win I think we're
146:24 way ahead now I think we're way ahead
146:26 but but um can I bring you back to they
146:29 lose I I think they're going to look at
147:31 two things they're going to say they
147:33 should have had a primary even if it was
147:35 a short primary they shouldn't have
147:36 picked her and then she's going to say I
147:38 shouldn't have picked this guy she
147:39 shouldn't have picked that guy that guy
147:41 the the lying about tanan Square
147:43 admitted that yeah the military record
147:45 assisant coach versus head coach little
147:48 thing so I did McDonald's last week
147:51 I saw that and I actually got a call
147:52 from your friends at Google from Sundar
147:55 that's pretty good right he said this is
147:57 the biggest thing we've had in years you
147:00 McDonald's McDonald's did you know that
147:02 it was one of the it was funny who's a
147:05 great guy by the way but he said this
147:07 McDonald's thing I want to tell you it's
147:09 one of the biggest things we've ever had
147:11 on Google it just hit but the reason I
147:14 did and I actually you know you never
147:15 know about this stuff I thought it was a
147:17 throwaway M I didn't think our
147:18 conversation is a throwaway but I
147:20 thought that was I thought I'd walk in
147:22 and that was only to highlight the fact
147:24 and I I have a friend he owns like 56 of
147:26 these McDonald's and he said you want to
147:28 use one I said yeah I love it so we went
148:30 there and the crowd was crazy you know
148:32 they had 28,000 people s around the
148:34 whole thing did you see the outside it
148:36 was crazy the cars couldn't get through
148:38 Secret Service was not exactly thrilled
148:40 we had no idea what the hell but I went
148:42 into the place and I did the French FY
148:45 thing and it just hit but that's like in
148:48 life sometimes you do I thought it was
148:50 like a quick throw we're going to be
148:51 there for 15 minutes then I said I've
148:54 worked here for 15 minutes which is 15
148:56 minutes more than she worked here she
148:59 lied about McDonald's and you
148:01 know proven that she never she well
148:05 McDonald's has no information no she has
148:07 no information she there's nobody the
148:09 manager said she never worked there you
148:11 know it was a certain place and he said
148:13 they never no she lied she's a liar you
148:16 know what they do they'll say like on
148:18 any one of the questions take any
148:21 they'll say it's the exact opposite of
148:23 what I say IVF he's against IVF the
148:27 fertilization right he's and and it's
148:30 the exact opposite I was I came out
149:32 immediately strongly in favor and they
149:34 do ads I'm against it it's wrong uh on
149:38 every single topic and you know she
149:40 changed policies on 15 I've never seen a
149:44 guy change anybody change on more than
149:46 one you know you can maybe get away with
149:48 one her whole life fr in every single
149:52 thing that she was for uh the
149:54 confiscation of gun she wants to conf
149:56 now she's saying everybody should have a
149:57 gun in fact we're going to get her a
149:59 magga cap I'm going to send her a magga
149:01 cap but she's changed and I don't think
149:04 people are buying it I don't think
149:05 people are buying it well some people
149:07 are buying it because they want to buy
149:09 it because it's blue no matter who
149:10 there's there's a certain percentage of
149:11 our population that's going to vote
149:13 Democrat no matter what that's true
149:15 they're pressured there's their their
149:16 Community their ideology it's as good
149:20 right is I don't understand why okay you
149:22 have a wall or you have a you know I
149:25 built 570 mil of wall everyone say I
149:28 built a lot of wall exactly the stuff
150:31 but you have a border what I don't
150:34 understand is who would want people to
150:36 come into our country from places
150:39 unknown like sometimes they'll say about
150:41 a fighter from Parts Unknown right
150:43 remember Hast from Parts he say from
150:47 parts and the old days those are the old
150:48 days that's even before you but
150:51 uh who would want people to come
150:54 in pouring into our country we don't
150:57 know anything about but that's I want to
150:59 ask you this why do you think they're
150:00 doing that I think because do you think
150:02 they're trying to buy votes do you think
150:04 they just want cheap labor like what is
150:06 what's the idea there's a couple of
150:08 theories they hate our country they're
150:10 stupid or they want to buy votes it's
150:13 one of those three things yeah they want
150:15 now they are trying to get people
150:16 registered who you know don't even know
150:18 what the country is and they're trying
150:19 to give people amnesty people that live
150:21 here they're try
150:22 toenship and they
150:24 want you think about the amount of money
150:26 that they've given them when they've
150:27 come here the food stamps the benefits
150:30 that even our poor people aren't getting
151:31 $200 billion and and that's a way low
151:34 number that's a way low you know it's
151:36 it's interesting New York has always
151:38 been like uh you know sort of like
151:41 always looking for money they've spent a
151:43 hundred billion do on this stuff I I
151:45 don't know where they and they're not
151:46 getting the money from the federal
151:48 government it's crazy and because the
151:51 mayor came out and said we can't live
151:55 like this they investigated him he gets
151:58 I by the way I called it I said he just
151:60 got himself indicted this group is
151:03 stupid but they're vicious they're
151:05 stupid people but they're vicious people
151:07 the 2020 elections you say you have all
151:10 this evidence that it was rigged why
151:13 haven't you put this evidence in a
151:15 consumable form and what did oh I did I
151:17 have I have books on it and and by the
151:20 way books have been written on
151:22 it we have an author named Hemingway who
151:26 is a great writer she wrote a book on it
151:28 but many books have been written on it
152:30 there are books that
152:32 are what's happened is judges don't want
152:35 to touch it they would say you don't
152:37 have standing they didn't rule on the
152:39 merits they ruled the merits never got
152:42 there the judges didn't have what it
152:47 took to turn over an election let's talk
152:49 about the potential vulnerabilities for
152:51 elections and election fraud one of them
152:53 is mail in ballots the other one is
152:57 the if someone can break into voting
152:60 machines if someone can hack voting
152:02 machines those are two huge
152:05 ones Elon Musk I think he said it
152:08 publicly I hope he did because I
152:09 wouldn't want to be the one but he's a
152:11 really smart guy and he's a very good
152:14 guy with computers right you'd say he's
152:16 he's one of the smartest people Al alive
152:17 anybody that can land that 20 story
152:19 building
152:20 and perfect and while he's doing
152:22 starlink while he's talk while he owns
152:25 Twitter and then he agrees to starlink
152:27 and he tweets 100 times a day he's an
152:29 amazing guy right he said to me that
153:33 unless you have paper ballots it can
153:35 never be an honest election that's a big
153:37 statement it's a big statement we should
153:39 go to paper ballots you know France did
153:42 they went the mail in voting and it was
153:44 all messed up you know the amazing thing
153:46 with the machines so we have the
153:48 machines they cost 10 times paper ballot
153:51 would cost 8% and they make paper
153:53 ballots they all watermarked and
153:54 everything else very sophisticated but
153:57 if you take a look paper ballots 8% the
153:01 cost and you're done by 9:00 in the
153:04 evening right now we have the
153:06 sophisticated machine it goes up to
153:08 heaven it goes all over the place and
153:10 down and around and they say we'll need
153:12 two weeks to figure out who the hell won
153:14 the election do you think that's by
153:15 Design yeah I do I think it's I think
153:17 it's very crooked that's my opinion
153:19 you're allowed to have it opinion what
153:21 could let's say you win in November what
153:24 can be done to mitigate these problems
153:27 what could be done at a you know at the
153:30 level that the president has power well
154:32 if I win that'll be this will be my last
154:34 election but I think I owe it to the
154:37 country yeah but I think I owe it to the
154:39 country we have to have Fair elections
154:41 so how can you fix that you know Jimmy
154:43 Carter was the in charge of a commission
154:45 you know that many years ago and they
154:48 put him in scoop Jackson and very
154:50 Senators you know distinguished people
154:52 that were retired and they came up with
154:54 a report and the report's primary
154:56 finding was you cannot have mailin
154:59 ballots because if it's a mailin ballot
154:03 you know I went to the voting booth the
154:05 last time whatever it was and I walked
154:07 in in Palm Beach and I walk in and they
154:10 know me they say Mr President could I
154:12 see your identific bom here's this
154:14 here's that everything and then you sit
154:17 and you they watch you sign and you
154:20 really there's not a lot you can do I
154:22 mean if you want it to be dishonest it's
154:23 sort of beautiful right if instead of
154:26 that I'm going to send them a ballot
154:28 right it has to go through the Postal
155:31 Services it has to go through a lot of
155:33 people they mail you houses that you
155:35 know the house was demolished and the
155:37 people have left and it it's so bad the
155:41 one thing with Jimmy Carter he had a
155:43 very strong commission who no mail and
155:47 bels and we're the only one that does
155:49 elections this way anymore they've
155:51 gotten away from them and this is a it
155:52 ticked up in a big way after Co it used
155:54 to be like soldiers serving overseas
155:56 they used to cheat yeah well they used
155:58 Co to certainly push this mail and
155:60 ballot another thing but that's but they
155:03 used Co to cheat but here's another and
155:05 the last election was a little bit of a
155:07 you couldn't even get security guys big
155:10 strong guys to watch you know what you'd
155:12 call them they'd call them and this they
155:14 were afraid to go out you know we had we
155:16 were in the middle of
155:17 Co we were in the middle of Co it right
155:20 smack in the middle and they didn't want
155:22 to die you know they didn't want to
155:24 catch it it was like in a way it was we
155:27 it was like a ghost
155:29 town and the whole thing but mail and
156:32 ballots are bad thing bad thing that
156:34 that certainly is is a problem Ma mail
156:37 and ballots are problem problem vo ID a
156:40 voter ID voter ID is the most bizarre
156:43 argument that I've never seen anybody
156:45 articulate in a way that's convincing
156:47 why don't need voter well it doesn't
156:49 make makes sense any other way I've
156:51 tried to strawman it or I've tried to
156:53 Steelman it rather I've tried to like
156:55 look at it from a position like why
156:56 would you not want people to have ID and
156:59 a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous
156:02 the you need an ID to get a driver's
156:04 license okay but here's now the next
156:05 step Gavin nsam one of the worst
156:08 governors in the
156:09 world and I used to frankly I used to
156:12 get along but I don't get along with him
156:13 because he's just too you know it's just
156:15 a whole con job but Gavin nusum the
156:18 other day signed a bill
156:20 that you are not allowed to ask a person
156:23 even ask them whether or not they have
156:25 voter ID now what could be a Char reason
156:28 why anybody they want that would be the
157:31 only thing that makes sense that's
157:32 taking it to the next level right now
157:35 you know you have ID the Democrat
157:37 National Convention when they had it the
157:39 last time I saw they had a sign like a
157:42 billboard on the the name of the person
157:45 where they live how they live who the
157:47 hell their boyfriends are every single
157:50 it was and a big picture that's for
157:52 there they have an ID a big ID it was
157:55 hanging like you were a prisoner it they
157:58 had these massive cards everything and
157:01 yet when it comes to the vote in theory
157:03 the most important thing we do okay when
157:05 you go to a grocery store you give ID
157:08 but for a vote it's supposed to be a
157:10 sacred thing and it it should be a
157:11 sacred thing no voter ID because they
157:14 want to cheat well it doesn't make sense
157:16 in any other way I've tried to look at
157:18 it there's no other way there I there's
157:20 no argument that anybody's presented
157:22 that makes any sense why you know the
157:24 funny thing Joe the Democrats the people
157:26 they all think you should have it in
157:28 other words you should have if you go to
157:29 the people Mrs Schwarz Mrs Smith Mr Mrs
158:33 Jones sure they say of course yeah
158:36 Democrats they say yes it's the
158:39 politicians that don't want it like
158:40 Schumer and these guys they don't want
158:42 it because they want to be able to cheat
158:44 because you know what if they didn't
158:46 have it okay who is going to vote for
158:48 somebody that wants open borders who's
158:50 going to vote for somebody that wants to
158:52 have uh Men playing in women's sports
158:54 you know I have never had one person
158:57 come up to me and say president you got
158:00 to do something to allow men to play in
158:02 women's sports have you ever just like
158:05 I've never been called by a Polster I
158:07 told you my little theory on polsters
158:08 okay I'm getting myself in trouble with
158:10 some of these things but I don't really
158:12 care nobody's ever come up to me and
158:15 said we want to have men playing women's
158:18 sports and you know I had I had a funny
158:22 thing at a property I own in California
158:26 I have a woman who's a very good athlete
158:28 and she works there as a manager and
159:30 Brian eracer the big uh Chicago Bear
159:33 great player you know uh ttime Allstar I
159:36 guess Hall of Famer a great guy big
159:38 strong guy and they she said oh he's one
159:41 of my favorite athletes can I have a
159:43 picture and I took a picture and I sent
159:45 and I noticed she was the size of his
159:47 leg his leg was bigger than she was and
159:50 I put it out should men play in women's
159:53 sport the whole it was just so
159:54 ridiculous um what's one of the most
159:57 bizarre and polarizing ideas that's
159:59 promoted by the left but who wants it
159:01 now unless you're going to cheat in
159:03 elections you're never going to get
159:04 nobody wants it I don't think anybody
159:06 wants it I've never I've been told
159:08 everything you know you can some people
159:09 want
159:10 this I don't know if anybody that wants
159:13 open borders nobody's ever come up to me
159:15 and say president you got to let the
159:16 world come into our country right now if
159:19 they won so they have 21 million I think
159:21 it's much higher than that because you
159:22 have Goda aways you know Goda aways
159:23 where they just walk in they walk in by
159:26 and the other thing you have is human
159:27 traffickers you have traffickers and
159:29 they traffic in women and they're going
160:31 wild now we used to you know you have to
160:34 look the trunk of cars can you believe
160:36 it they put women in trunks they'll put
160:38 three women in a trunk these people are
160:40 savages they're horrible the worst
160:42 people the you and they're making the
160:44 kind of money they make on drugs they're
160:46 almost making on trafficking now and the
160:48 thing that's made it hot is the internet
160:51 that's what you know you think of it
160:53 almost as an ancient thing but it's the
160:55 internet but who would want to have
160:57 these things who would want to have
160:59 there's so many the transgender
160:01 operations where they're allowed to take
160:03 your child when he goes to school and
160:06 turn him into a male to a female without
160:09 parental consent who wants this does
160:12 anybody want this I've never heard of
160:14 anyone and I can go into 10 different
160:16 things the only way they get them is by
160:20 no voter ID you can't have voter ID they
160:23 don't want any they want to cheat
160:25 there's only one reason cuz the voter ID
160:28 is so basic it's the most basic thing
161:31 it's very basic who would want this they
161:34 want it so they can cheat because their
161:36 policies are no good their Pol I'll tell
161:38 you they're very smart when it comes to
161:41 that they're very smart although they're
161:43 not smart in terms of uh politics in a
161:46 way because what do they have that
161:48 people want they really don't have they
161:50 give away a lot of Health Care a lot of
161:51 stuff but for the most part their
161:53 policies are terrible their policy on
161:55 Military she's running on a tax she's
161:58 going to raise your taxes you got to
161:59 hear this we are going to raise your
161:02 taxes and the people clap but who is
161:04 going to win with her all my life I grew
161:08 up with politicians lower
161:10 taxes she's she's politi in that we are
161:14 going to raise your taxes well they want
161:16 to raise the idea is you want to raise
161:17 the taxes to the highest earners I know
161:19 but they think Millionaires and
161:21 billionaires are not paying their Fair
161:23 shares it doesn't work that way well
161:24 it's a narrative right and it's a
161:26 narrative that appeals to people that
161:27 are not doing well and like yeah our
161:29 problems are that these rich people are
162:31 not paying taxes well the problems are
162:33 the rich people are going to leave and
162:34 they're going to close up their
162:35 companies and then the other people
162:36 aren't going to have jobs you know
162:38 that's what happens it does happen in
162:39 other countries but the the whole
162:41 because you you brought it up I'll tell
162:42 you what we just uh uh he's doing a very
162:45 good job in Virginia Glenn yunan I don't
162:47 know if you like him not like him I
162:49 don't know but they oh you don't I'm the
162:51 governor of Virginia so we have a case
162:54 where they found thousands of illegal
162:57 ballots a judge just rulle that they
162:60 have to be able to vote just happened
162:02 today just before I walked in here I
162:04 heard uh a judge just ruled that you
162:08 have to keep those people in they're
162:10 illegal they're illegal votes now I
162:12 think they'll be overturned at the next
162:14 court one thing I found because I had a
162:16 couple of things that they got
162:17 overturned a little bit you know the
162:18 system because the system
162:20 you have to hope that the appella judges
162:24 are honest otherwise we don't have a
162:26 country anymore it's very important but
162:29 the whole thing with the legal ballots
163:30 has got to be looked at you got to have
163:32 you have to have voter ID and you have
163:34 to have additional ID you have to have
163:36 an ID that shows that you're a citizen
163:38 of the country I agree they don't want
163:40 that either I agree um one of the things
163:42 that I want to talk to you about is the
163:44 JFK files and one of the things that you
163:47 said was that if they showed you what
163:50 they showed me this was your quote you
163:52 wouldn't want people to know it
163:54 either um
163:57 so I I opened them up
163:01 partially I was met with from good
163:04 people I mean you know look at me good
163:06 people people that were well-meaning
163:08 Mike Pompeo was one of them he's a good
163:11 person uh they called me they said sir
163:15 would rather have you not after and I
163:19 did open them
163:20 but I was asked by some people not to
163:23 open them there's a Martin Luther King
163:24 file too by the way that they'd like to
163:26 see I don't know if you know but there
163:28 is that but but JFK in particular so
164:33 they call me a lot of good people call
164:34 me people that I you know that you would
164:36 find reasonable people and they asked me
164:39 not to do it so I said well we'll close
164:41 it for another time but if I win I'm
164:44 going to open them up I'm just going to
164:45 open enough times why didn't you open it
164:46 up the first time though what was the
164:48 hesitation though addresses people that
164:51 are still living there are people that
164:53 are affected um and there could be some
164:56 National Security reason that for you
164:58 know that I don't have to necessarily
164:59 know about but some very good talented
164:02 people asked me not to do it I opened it
164:05 up and then they said would it be
164:07 possible for us to do that a different
164:09 day what how much of it did you read
164:12 into uh
164:15 uh I think it's going to be just fine to
164:17 open it let me put it that way I think
164:19 it's fine it's going to be time it's a
164:21 cleansing you know it's really a
164:22 cleansing so I'm going to do it I'm
164:24 going to do it immediately almost
164:25 immediately upon entering office well
164:27 the thing when people look at it from
164:29 the outside and you sort of imagine what
165:32 could be a reason why they would not
165:35 release those files it would be there's
165:38 people that were implicated
165:40 assassination yeah well when there
165:43 living people you generally tend not to
165:45 want to do it when people are still
165:47 living living people that formerly work
165:49 for the government for the government
165:51 and living people that were somehow
165:53 involved in it and you tend not to do
165:54 that but it's time to open them um I
165:58 can't tell you whether or not uh they're
165:00 going to find anything of interest and I
165:02 did partially open I think I I've opened
165:05 50% but I was asked not to do it and I I
165:09 I thought that was a reasonable ask but
165:11 now I'm going to do it I'm going to do
165:12 it very soon there's a lot of interest
165:14 in it one of the things that there's a
165:15 lot of interest in uh the uh people
165:18 coming from space you know yes and I
165:20 know you're interested in oh I'm very
165:21 interested in that how much did they
165:22 tell you about that a lot really yeah
165:25 what' they tell you how much can you
165:27 tell so I how's that work is it like
165:29 super top secret tell you know well
166:31 based on Hunter Biden I can say whatever
166:33 the hell I want right but no but I
166:35 interviewed a few people it's never been
166:38 my thing I have to be honest I I have
166:39 never been a Believer I have people that
166:41 area 51 or whatever it is I think it's
166:44 the number one tourist attraction in the
166:46 whole country or something Area 51 at
166:48 Las V do you know that right sure I know
166:50 what it is so anyway but it's a big
166:52 tourist thing so I interviewed jet
166:56 Pilots that say they saw something if
166:00 you saw them you'd love to have them as
166:02 I've had a couple in here Commander
166:03 David fraver yeah I had him in who had
166:06 that sighting in 2004 very very
166:08 compelling with visual video evidence
166:11 radar evidence I Brian Graves I don't
166:13 believe his name but I I interviewed jet
166:17 Pilots that uh were solid people the
166:21 perfect I mean great Pilots great
166:23 everything and they said we saw things
166:26 sir that were were very strange like a
167:30 round ball but it wasn't a comet or a
167:32 meteor it was something and it was going
167:36 four times faster than an F22 which is a
167:38 very fast plan you
167:40 know and it was round um which isn't in
167:44 theory a great shape so when you were
167:46 talking to these people was was this
167:49 something thing that you were compelled
167:51 to have conversations about was this
167:52 your personal interest a little bit it
167:54 it's not a great interest for me but
167:56 it's a little interest I get that
167:58 question as much as almost any question
167:00 do you think that we have aliens coming
167:02 you know flying around or whatever what
167:04 do you
167:06 think there's no reason not to I mean
167:09 there's no reason not to think that Mars
167:11 and all these planets don't have life
167:13 you know because well Mars we've had
167:15 probes there and Rovers and I don't
167:17 think there's any life there well maybe
167:18 it's life that we don't know but maybe
167:20 well maybe there was life there at one
167:21 point in time this is the speculation
167:23 about Mars that Mars had a an atmosphere
167:26 at one point in time a long time ago
167:28 that could support life it ALS also had
167:29 large bodies of water but we've had no
168:32 evidence of even bacterial life that
168:34 exists on Mars but the univ not been a
168:36 big thing for me I mean when I looked at
168:38 what China did to this ad they would
168:40 have never done it with me where they
168:42 put the balloon up and a lot of people
168:43 thought and a lot of people thought for
168:45 a little while that that was one of
168:47 these things well that's a lot of the
168:48 speculation too that some of these
168:49 drones that hover over battleships that
168:51 these are Chinese drones and that
168:53 they're not UFOs they could be also
168:55 there's some super sophisticated I did
168:56 interview a let's say three or four guys
168:60 that and without tremendous interest if
168:04 you had
168:05 them as I said you'd love to have me as
168:07 your children solid beautiful people
168:12 they said sir there's something there
168:14 you know they' there's something they
168:15 said it yeah yeah I've talked to quite a
168:17 few of them they're not conspiracy guys
168:19 well I mean the just the commander David
168:21 fraver thing in 2004 off the coast of
168:23 San Diego they clocked that thing going
168:25 from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50
168:27 in a second yeah they don't know what it
168:29 is that's tough to beat yeah they they
169:31 saw something in the water it was
169:33 hovering over that something that was
169:34 making a disturbance in the water they
169:36 got video evidence of this thing two
169:39 different fighter jets with pilots in
169:41 them saw it there's you know Visual
169:44 Evidence photographic evidence video
169:46 evidence radar evidence whatever the
169:48 hell it is it moves in a way that would
169:49 turn a human being into Jello if they
169:51 inside of it the GeForce no one would
169:53 survive like what is that and we don't
169:56 they it doesn't have a heat signature
169:57 they don't know what their propulsion
169:59 system was but when you fly in some of
169:02 these
169:03 jets these Pilots have to be in great
169:05 shape oh yeah I flew with the Blue
169:07 Angels once yeah I got the fly I guess
169:11 and those are older machines and they're
169:12 crazy when you when you fly in
169:14 somebody's things amazing yeah but you
169:17 got to be special but these things these
169:19 people are en counting are far superior
169:21 to what we know of yeah do is it
169:23 possible that there's some military or
169:26 government program that you weren't that
169:29 they didn't tell you
170:31 about I I think I had a great
170:33 relationship with the military basically
170:35 but you know I didn't like certain
170:37 people I would have gotten them out if I
170:38 thought if I were if the election was
170:41 different I would have fired you know
170:43 all of them quickly some most of them I
170:45 did fire uh Biden should have fired
170:48 every military person involved with
170:51 Afghanistan he should have had a lot of
170:53 firings you know if you look at him he
170:54 told Israel not to do anything and at
170:56 least Israel's not going to looking at a
170:58 bomb the way they would have been think
170:59 if they listen to Biden they'd be
170:02 waiting for a bomb to drop on their head
170:04 right
170:04 now he's been wrong about so much I
170:07 guess you'd have to say that she's been
170:08 wrong too because you know they she
170:10 always said they made the decision
170:12 together but uh Israel didn't follow his
170:16 advice and I think it was a very uh you
170:19 know there it's a very the Middle East
170:21 is rapidly changing you know there are
170:24 prophets that say the world will come to
170:26 an end in the Middle East you know that
170:28 right and we have weapons today that are
171:32 so scary when you look I rebuilt them
171:35 all and when you look at the weapons we
171:37 have today the biggest threat we have in
171:39 the world today is nuclear weapons and
171:42 we have other weapons too that are
171:44 devastating but the nuclear weapons the
171:46 biggest threat we have in the world
171:48 today and that's what
171:49 you I was talking about deescalation
171:53 with both China and Russia I'm telling
171:56 you we were going to deescalate they
171:58 were going to deescalate you got to be
171:59 careful we it's a little tricky playing
171:01 with them because they say we're going
171:03 to do it and they don't do it maybe but
171:06 they understood the curse too it's a
171:07 curse it's uh China's way behind us but
171:10 they'll catch us within five years so
171:12 let's imagine let's let's say you win in
171:15 November what do you do differently and
171:17 how do you change this course that it
171:20 seems we are on for World War II how do
171:22 you get us out of Ukraine how do you
171:25 stop what's going on in the Middle East
171:26 how do you put a stop to this well it's
171:29 it's a very uh to me it's an easy
172:31 question because I think I can do it
172:33 easily but it's a complex question in
172:35 the sense that the times change every
172:38 day
172:38 changes uh who's winning who's not
172:41 winning I mean Russia is a war machine
172:44 whether you like it or not it Just
172:46 grinds along grinds along you speak to
172:49 people like Victor Oran he'll tell you
172:51 it's a just a big fat War Machine and
172:55 that's what's happening you look at
172:56 what's happened to
172:57 Ukraine if I were there it would have
172:59 never happened but what you what could
172:01 you do now if you get into office in
172:03 January what could you do right now uh
172:07 you would get both of them I know both
172:09 very well and and again I I I cannot I
172:12 do not want to tell you you know for the
172:14 purpose of looking smart to fight people
172:16 that you know that say oh he was great
172:18 because because if I told you exactly
172:21 what I do I could I could never make the
172:23 deal all I can tell you is that I would
172:25 meet with Putin and I would meet with
172:27 him and I know exactly what I'd say to
172:29 each one of them and I believe that as
173:31 president-elect I would get that war
173:33 stopped and stopped fast you know we
173:37 have tremendous power in the United
173:38 States if you know how to use the power
173:41 I stopped other Wars just by the use of
173:43 tariffs I got macron of France good gu
173:47 like a friend of mine but a wise guy and
173:50 he's a person that likes France and he
173:52 was going to tax our companies I say you
173:55 and I sent all the smartest guys I sent
173:57 manuch and they all failed me and I said
173:60 I'll do it myself and I called him I
173:01 said Emanuel you're taxing American
173:04 companies we're not going to allow you
173:05 to do that oh Donald I cannot do nothing
173:08 I could do it's already been passed I
173:10 said Emanuel if you do that I'm going to
173:13 put a 100% tariff when your wines and
173:15 Champagnes are coming to the United
173:17 States and you're going to regret that
173:20 you ever did it he said Don please
173:22 that's not fair anyway within about two
173:24 minutes he dropped the whole thing it
173:25 was massive amounts of money against
173:27 American companies I have to protect
173:30 American companies so why doesn't the
174:31 bid Administration do this because
174:32 they're incompetent they don't know how
174:34 to talk look they met in
174:37 Alaska with uh the Chinese and the
174:41 Chinese lectured them about how badly we
174:44 treat people right okay I mean think of
174:48 it
174:49 you remember that it was like in they
174:51 didn't talk to me that way they never
174:53 they respected me they respected our
174:56 country they don't respect our country
174:57 they don't respect Biden they don't
174:60 respect her they're dreaming about her
174:03 because she's incompetent she's not a
174:05 smart person look she can't put two
174:08 sentences together she talks I watched
174:10 her two nights I watched her last night
174:12 too was the same thing she's not a smart
174:15 person these guys are very smart and
174:18 they're very Street wise and they're
174:19 very tricky and evil and
174:22 dangerous and if she
174:24 becomes the president of the United
174:26 States which I can't believe can happen
174:29 uh I don't think this country is going
175:31 to make it I I don't think we'll ever
175:33 be I think I think bad just really bad
175:36 things will happen to our country and
175:38 you know what I look at the outside
175:39 forces and I say they can all be handled
175:42 because we have a pot of gold but we're
175:44 not going to have that pot of gold to
175:46 play with anymore you know it's a great
175:47 negotiating thing
175:49 I told you I I knocked out this massive
175:52 car company going to take all of our car
175:54 business from Detroit I knocked it out
175:57 just by my rhetoric rhetorically I
175:59 said they'll never sell a car in here
175:02 I'll put tariffs I don't care they're
175:04 2,000% they're never going to build that
175:06 plant and is it possible to apply that
175:08 same thing to the electronics that we
175:09 use one of the things that disturbs me
175:11 greatly is that all of our phones are
175:13 made overseas and then some of our
175:15 phones are made in places like yes and
175:17 the chips and some of our phones are
175:19 made in places like foxcon where they
175:20 have Nets around the building to keep
175:22 people from jumping off the roof because
175:23 they have so many suicides like wouldn't
175:25 it be better to have an americanmade
175:27 iPhone where you know people are paid
175:29 good wages they have health insurance
176:31 they're taken care of they can live a
176:32 good life where you're not buying a
176:34 piece of electronics that's cheaper
176:37 because someone has to suffer a horrible
176:39 in a horrible way that's not even legal
176:41 in the United States it's not even legal
176:43 to have them work that way in the United
176:44 States so they get these people to build
176:46 them overseas you do it but but let me
176:48 just say
176:49 that chip deal is so bad we put up
176:51 billions of dollars for Rich companies
176:53 to come in and borrow the money and
176:55 build chip companies here and they're
176:57 not going to give us the good companies
176:59 anyway all you had to do is charge them
176:01 tariffs if you were to put a tariff on
176:04 the chips coming in you would have been
176:06 able to just like the auto companies no
176:09 different more sophisticated but no
176:11 different you know Taiwan they stole our
176:14 chip
176:15 business okay they want us to protect
176:18 and want protection they don't pay us
176:20 money for the protection you know the
176:22 mob makes you pay money right but with
176:25 these countries that we protect I got
176:27 hundreds of billions of dollars from
176:29 NATO countries that were never paying us
177:32 and my biggest fan is stoltenberg who
177:34 just left as the you know director
177:37 General as the Secretary General good
177:40 guy he said Bush came he made a speech
177:42 Obama came he made a speech Trump came
177:44 he said you guys aren't paying you got
177:46 to pay and they said will you protect us
177:48 from Russia if we don't I said no you
177:51 got to pay if you don't pay billions of
177:53 dollars came in to
177:55 Nato when I see us paying a lot of money
177:58 to have people build chip that's not the
177:00 way you didn't have to put up 10 cents
177:02 you could have done it with a series of
177:04 tariffs in other words you tariff it's
177:06 so high that they will come and build
177:09 their chip companies for nothing in
177:11 other words Joe you put a big tariff on
177:14 the chips coming in I say you don't have
177:17 to pay the Tariff all you have to do was
177:18 build your plant in the United States we
177:21 didn't have to give them the money to
177:22 build the plant besides that they're
